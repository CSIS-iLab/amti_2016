		<title>Transparency in Troubled Seas: Welcome to AMTI</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Five years ago, it would have been difficult to imagine that <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/essays/2013/rhyme-of-history">eminent historians</a> and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/just-how-likely-is-another-world-war/375320/2/">political scientists</a> would draw analogies between territorial issues in the East and South China Seas, and the Balkans on the eve of the First World War. Yet in the very recent past, maritime claims, resource competition, and contentious international arbitration in the Indo-Pacific region have seized the attention of policymakers, pundits, and the public at large. Maritime Asia also has great promise, however: It holds over half of the world’s <a href="http://amti.csis.org/atlas/#population">population</a>; Its waterways carry 50 percent of <a href="http://amti.csis.org/atlas/#trade">global commercial shipping</a>; Its seas contain vast <a href="http://amti.csis.org/atlas/#scs-resources">proven and probable oil and gas reserves</a>; The region grows <a href="http://amti.csis.org/atlas/#tpp-rcep">more economically interdependent by the year</a>. Increasing interstate competition, however, raises the risk that this dynamic potential could turn to peril if an isolated incident at sea escalates into a global crisis.

Growing maritime tensions are especially vexing because they have been mounting in an environment of opacity. Littoral geography makes it difficult to monitor events at sea in real time. While most major geopolitical developments are audited by the 24 hour news cycle and pervasive social media, it is difficult to know when open-ocean actors are promoting free navigation or resorting to coercion. Moreover, because so many states have deep national interests in Indo-Pacific waterways, it can be difficult to adjudicate amongst available narratives. There has previously been no single, reliable authority for information on maritime security developments in Asia.

The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative seeks to change this. We are an interactive, regularly-updated source for information, analysis, and policy exchange on maritime security issues in the Indo-Pacific region. AMTI takes a web magazine format, and features completely new content every two weeks—and more often that that when news is breaking. The AMTI team tracks news outlets and research resources around the globe to give you the latest and most important information updates using interactive maps. We also bring you insightful analysis by top maritime security experts in the United States and in Asia. Additionally, the website hosts several research resources that rely on cutting-edge technology to help you navigate this important policy space. These include our 175 year-long maritime history <a href="http://amti.csis.org/timeline/">Timeline</a>, our <a href="http://amti.csis.org/atlas/">Atlas of regional maps</a>, and our <a href="http://amti.csis.org/documents/">primary source Documents Library</a>. And if you believe that there are sources that we have overlooked, we encourage you to contribute more documents to this new and growing project.

The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative is founded on the belief that transparency will help to encourage stability—that if we work from the same set of facts, we may find opportunities for dialogue, confidence-building, and cooperation. We hope that this new platform for information and exchange will help bring some clarity to the murky waters of maritime Asia. The stakes couldn’t be higher.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Defining Maritime Asia</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Most think of maritime Asia in the context of the Western Pacific littoral, the long swath of near shore waters that run from the Russian Pacific coast to Southeast Asia. Or, that maritime Asia is defined by the competing claims in the East and South China Seas and the rise of the Chinese Navy. Maritime Asia is far more than that. It matters now and it will matter more so in the future, but to think strategically about Asia we must first define maritime Asia.

Perhaps it is our 13 years of war in the Middle East that limits our strategic and maritime thinking about Asia or draws us too quickly to specific security issues. To understand and enable a longer view toward Asia we must step back, open the aperture and look more broadly at the geography and growth of Asia. The foundation of maritime Asia is about commerce and the dependence of Asian nations on the sea. It is about sea routes and resources (energy, mineral and protein - fish) that feed Asian economies. In the terms of the great naval strategist, Alfred Thayer Mahan, it is about the “great highways” and “wide common” of the sea. Accordingly, maritime Asia should be thought of, collectively, as the Pacific and Indian Oceans; or, appropriately, the Indo-Pacific maritime. Soon, the ice-diminished Arctic Ocean will increase in importance as the “great highways” and the “wide common” there become more accessible adding to the web of sea-lanes that feed Asia.

In Asia, the strategic importance of the sea is well understood and the maritime competition there has begun. Indeed, Mahan’ strategic view is more likely to be referenced in Beijing than in Washington. That is ironic, as the United States, a Pacific nation, has been the strategic stabilizer in the region for decades assuring freedom of the seas and providing the security and predictability that underpinned the explosive growth of Asia. But as economies rise, especially those dependent on trade, so too do navies. Obviously, China looms large as it relies, as do other Asian countries, on Middle East oil. Mineral resources from Africa and Australia are also vital to continued growth. Those resources move on sea-lanes that traverse the Indian Ocean, heightening attention from India. But more than the use of sea lanes, it is China’s more strategic initiatives, access to ports, more frequent naval deployments and port visits in the Arabian Gulf, Pakistan, Africa and Sri Lanka and an articulated objective of a “Maritime Silk Road” that unsettles some in the region. Beyond these activities, the proliferation of submarines throughout Asia, to include Chinese and Indian ballistic missile submarines, and Chinese and Indian aircraft carriers will add to the complexity of the maritime environment. Japan, which already possesses a highly capable navy, will respond to China’s growing maritime capacity. Russia will seek to remain a consequential naval power in the Pacific and assure its Artic sea-lane, the Northern Sea Route.

As America looks to the future, we must define maritime Asia more broadly, recognize the strategic competition over the “great highways” and the “wide common” of Asia is well underway, and realize that strategic competition matters greatly to the United States as a future Pacific and global power.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Xi Meets Abe: Skillful Diplomacy but Tensions Remain</title>
		<link>http://amti.csis.org/xi-meets-abe-skillful-diplomacy-but-tensions-remain/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On November 10, 2014, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and President Xi Jinping of China held a bilateral meeting on the margins of APEC in Beijing. Though a summit meeting between these two Asian giants should be a matter of course given their economic interdependence and rising geopolitical tensions, the Chinese side had refused to meet Abe until now. The two leaders’ first official exchange in person does not eliminate underlying problems in Sino-Japanese relations, but it does send the signal throughout the Chinese system that engagement with Tokyo is necessary -- and this might in turn open greater opportunities for transparency and confidence-building.

Until now Beijing had adamantly demanded two conditions for a summit. The first was that Abe publicly commit to not visiting the controversial Yasukuni Shrine; the second was that he admit the existence of a dispute with China over the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. Abe would not do the first for political and personal reasons and the Japanese government would not do the second because it maintains that the Senkakus are irrefutably Japanese sovereign territory and therefore no “dispute” exists to speak of (a position identical to Britain’s position on the Falklands and most other similar international situations). Tokyo was particularly loathe to concede these points under Chinese pressure around the Senkakus, since that would send a signal of weakness that would affect the entire Western Pacific.

Beijing ultimately did not receive what it claimed to demand on either condition. On the first condition, a November 7 joint Sino-Japanese statement declared that both sides were “facing history squarely and looking forward to the future,” which provided room for each side to interpret the outcome as necessary for domestic audiences. Whether there was an explicit Japanese pledge not to visit Yasukuni is unclear. I doubt it was black and white, but most informed observers in Tokyo do expect that Abe will not visit the shrine in the near future having fulfilled his personal desire to do so in his first year in office and perhaps this was conveyed. On the second Chinese condition, however, there can be little doubt: Abe did not cave to the demand that he acknowledge a sovereignty dispute. Instead, Abe and Xi agreed to “recognize that the two countries hold a different view over the tense situation in the East China Sea, including those around the Senkaku Islands.” This was a skillful formulation that did not acknowledge a legal dispute about the sovereignty of the islands, but did allow the Chinese side to point to some new tone in Japanese declaratory policy.

Both leaders had reasons to want a summit. Xi would have looked petty to other leaders if he had refused to meet Abe while hosting an APEC summit designed to improve cooperation in the region. The diversion of Japanese foreign direct investment from China to Southeast Asia has also alarmed Chinese officials concerned about lower growth rates at home. Finally, Beijing’s strategy to isolate Abe has largely failed outside of South Korea, since the Prime Minister has held successful summits with over 100 world leaders in two years of whirlwind diplomacy. For his part, Abe needs to maintain a focus on economic recovery and recognizes that reassuring moves with Beijing help build confidence in the U.S.-Japan alliance as Washington and Tokyo revise Defense Guidelines to strengthen deterrence in the region. Former Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda also deserves credit for changing the tone in bilateral relations with his frequent visits to China.

The test of whether the Abe-Xi meeting really marks a change in East China Sea tensions, of course lies ahead. Will Chinese maritime incursions and aerial overflights around the Senkakus abate so that diplomacy can proceed on firm ground? Building a “strategic relationship of mutual benefit” will take much more than crafty language. But this is a start.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Step Forward in US-China Military Ties: Two CBM Agreements</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 1998 the United States and China established the Military Maritime Consultative Agreement (MMCA) to avoid accidents when their respective maritime and air forces operate in close proximity. Sixteen years of negotiations yielded little progress, until now. Two agreements on military confidence building measures were inked at the US-China summit in Beijing: notification of major military activities and a code of conduct for safe conduct of naval and air military encounters. Together, they hold out promise that despite persisting mistrust and ongoing preparations to deter and defeat the other side if conflict breaks out, the US and Chinese militaries can work together to reduce misperception, increase predictability, and lower the risk of accident that could result in inadvertent escalation in a crisis.

Both initiatives were proposed by President Xi Jinping in June 2013 when he met with President Obama in Sunnylands. The accords are works in progress; the areas agreed to so far are limited, but there are expectations that these will be expanded through ongoing negotiations. In addition, there is an understanding that the agreements are voluntary and are not targeting a “third party.” The notification of respective major military activities will include two elements: defense reports and military exercises. The US will notify China when it issues reports such as the Defense Strategic Guidance, the Quadrennial Defense Review and the annual DoD report to Congress on military and security developments involving the PRC. China will notify the US when it issues its Defense White Paper and other such reports that it may produce in the future. Mutual notification of major shifts in defense policies will also be included.

The two militaries will inform each other when they conduct major exercises in the Asia-Pacific region. The timing of notification of both reports and exercises will be left up to each side to determine, although the hope is that over time both militaries will move toward advance, rather than ex post facto notification. Notification of other major military activities will be discussed and added as annexes. The US hopes to reach agreement in the future on reciprocal notification of ballistic missile launches, including space launches. So far the PLA has been non-committal. China already has an agreement with Russia to notify each other of ballistic missile launches in the direction of each other’s territory that went into effect in December 2012.

The maritime code of conduct will include guidelines for ship operators when they sail near each other at sea. These guidelines are based on internationally recognized rules of navigation including the 1972 Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS), and the Code of Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES). In subsequent negotiations, the two militaries will negotiate procedures for deconflicting operations when aircraft encounter each other and between aircraft and ships.

Beijing resisted concluding military CBM agreements with the US for years, even after the 2001 collision between a Chinese fighter jet and a US surveillance plane, primarily because it did not want to appear to give legitimacy to US close-in surveillance operations along China’s coast. Under Xi Jinping, however, China has signaled that it not only wants to avoid accidents, but also wants to establish a more cooperative relationship with the US military as part of an overall “new type of major power relations” that Xi first proposed in early 2012. Xi has apparently instructed the PLA to engage constructively with

US military counterparts, including in joint exercises, and to avoid dangerous intercepts that could result in mishaps.

Agreement on these basic military CBMs is a good start. As maritime patrols and aerial activities have increased in disputed waters and near contentious territories, so too has the risk of an accident that could spiral out of control. These steps, if implemented and followed by additional measures, can reduce the potential for mishaps between the US and Chinese militaries, as well as provide a template that can be applied to other regional military rivalries, such as China and Japan.

Progressing to advance notification of major military activities and expanding the scope of military activities to include ballistic missile and ASAT tests will add more substance. Expanding the maritime code of conduct accord to include aircraft is essential, since air accidents are more likely and more dangerous than naval incidents. As is the case with any agreement, implementation is key, and the provisions in these agreements should be mandatory rather than voluntary when both sides are ready. Periodic meetings to discuss compliance and any violations that occur will also contribute to the shared goals of reducing misunderstanding and building a sustained and substantive bilateral military relationship.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>South China Sea Action at the East Asia Summit?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The stakes in Asia’s maritime security tensions are high and getting higher. As each year the region moves closer to the global center of gravity in economic weight, military power and demographics, so too the consequences of any strategic breakdown among its powers become more grave.

Accordingly, it is more important than ever to work out what is going on. Yet there are confusing, contradictory narratives. Consider recent developments.

First, the good news. After years of frostiness and risk-fraught incidents at sea, China and Japan are back on speaking terms, just. President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met briefly just before Monday’s Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Beijing, in the first formal contact between the leaders of the two East Asian powers since 2012. The precise terms and conditions of this bonsai-proportioned rapprochement remain unclear, but broadly it seems that Japan has agreed to acknowledge that the two countries’ hold different views of the sovereignty of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands – a dispute by any other name.

More importantly from the point of view of regional peace and security, there are hints that long-suspended dialogue will resume towards developing operational channels of communication to prevent an encounter between Chinese and Japanese maritime forces from escalating into conflict. Whatever else has prompted this week’s mutual face-saving between Xi and Abe, it is fair to assume that somewhere within the Chinese system, the balance has finally begun to tilt away from risk-taking and towards risk-management as a policy touchstone on the handling of maritime issues.

There may be much to criticise about Abe’s reluctance to squarely face up to history – which his government is now signalling some willingness to do. But there is also much to commend about the disciplined way that Japan’s naval, airforce and coastguard personnel have face up to provocation for many months. History may show that the deterrent effect of this stance has helped shift the region from an unusually dangerous phase.

None of this leaves room for complacency. As President Obama flies east for a frenetic round of summitry – APEC closely followed by the East Asia Summit and the G20 – the locus of instability has moved from the East China Sea to the more complex differences of the South China Sea.

In both cases, historical animosities, nationalism, resource pressures and strategic imperatives are combining to generate tensions that can at best be managed, not resolved.

The newfound spirit of coexistence between China and Japan will have a downside if it allows Beijing now to concentrate coercive attention on one of its small Southeast Asian competitors for sovereignty in the South China Sea, whether the Philippines or Vietnam. Instead, the hope is that policy actors in China are beginning to realise that allowing or fostering tension in those waters, too, is in nobody’s interests.

An early test of whether the Chinese approach has comprehensively changed will come with the East Asia Summit (EAS), due to convene over the next few days in Myanmar. This is the most representative high-level forum in Indo-Pacific Asia, involving the leaders of the 10 ASEAN countries, plus China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, New Zealand, Russia and the United States.

The EAS is rightly mandated to consider region-wide strategic issues. By all means, the leaders should use this platform to focus on common concerns, like Ebola and the chilling rise of so-called Islamic State, better known as Daesh. And leaders, including President Obama, would be right also to endorse the progress in China-Japan relations. But the EAS cannot afford to be silent on the deepening trouble in the South China Sea, including China’s island-building and looming militarization of Johnson Reef and Fiery Cross Reef.

This means some real, live, unscripted exchanges of views on how to manage security tensions in the Indo-Pacific's most critical sea lanes. China's sincerity on negotiating a Code of Conduct ought to be tested with a call for a freeze on build new structures or changing land features in contested waters. And some signals need to be sent about the need for the EAS to evolve into more than just a meeting: it needs be affirmed as the keystone of regional security, with <a href="http://www.iseas.edu.sg/news_content.cfm?news_id=4DF042B8-9776-1320-45D252B323E705C4">formal links</a> to other promising institutions like the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting Plus, and a secretariat so that countries can put their crisis-management proposals and their concerns – including <a href="http://www.europeangeostrategy.org/2014/07/1914-2014-eu-share-asia-pacific-history-lessons/">hard data</a> about maritime security tensions – onto the record.

For President Obama to let this moment pass, or to assume that ASEAN partners do not want him to demonstrate principled leadership, would be a major diplomatic opportunity lost - conceding momentum and solidarity that he or his successor would then have to struggle to regain.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In an effort to strengthen China’s regional leadership role and promote its new Asian security concept, China’s military convened the fifth Xiangshan Forum, November 20-22. Previously a venue held in alternate years for foreign scholars and the PLA to conduct exchanges on international security issues, this year’s conference was upgraded to an annual Track 1.5 defense meeting designed to emulate, and perhaps to undermine, the long-standing Shangri-La Dialogue held in Singapore by the United Kingdom’s Institute of International Strategic Studies. Hosted by China’s Society of Military Sciences under the auspices of the Ministry of National Defense, the newly upgraded Xiangshan Forum included 20 officials at or above deputy defense minister, and representatives from 40 countries in East Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, and four international organizations.

The conference theme was “Building an Asian Community of Shared Destiny,” an objective stressed by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Diplomatic Work Conference on Periphery Diplomacy held in October 2013. The keynote speech was delivered by Chinese Defense Minister Chang Wanquan, who began his remarks by recalling China’s “wretched history” marked by the “unrelenting aggression of foreign powers.” Alongside calls for the implementation of Xi’s vision of an Asian region based on “common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security,” Chinese speakers condemned the persistence of “Cold War mentality,” “zero-sum game,” “worship of force,” and the strengthening of U.S.-led bilateral military alliances.

The “Asia for Asians” message that Xi Jinping delivered in his speech to the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) in May was reiterated by Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin in a speech to the delegates. “Asian countries bear primary responsibility for the security of their region,” Liu declared. He and other Chinese officials also insisted that China views Asia as open and inclusive, though they failed to reconcile these seemingly contradictory concepts.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel’s harsh criticism of China at the Shangri-La Dialogue in June apparently precipitated Beijing’s decision to elevate the Xiangshan Forum. A PLA officer privately admitted that China wanted a gathering with representatives from a broader spectrum of countries who would criticize not only Chinese policies but U.S. policies as well. A Russian scholar was among those who helped to achieve this goal by accusing the U.S. of instigating the crisis in Ukraine and attempting to carrying out color revolutions around the world. Expressions of concern about China’s actions in the South China Sea were unavoidable, however. Senior defense officials from Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar, and the Philippines made explicit references to tensions in the South China Sea, though they stopped short of naming China as the perpetrator, and called for their peaceful management and resolution.

Breakout sessions were held on maritime disputes, regional security architecture and counter-terrorism. In the panel on maritime disputes that I attended, there were heated exchanges about the cause of rising tensions and impact of the U.S. rebalance to Asia. Chinese participants insisted that the U.S. is exploiting friction between China and its neighbors to strengthen its regional position and emboldening regional nations to challenge Chinese sovereignty. Speakers from various countries proposed the implementation of confidence building measures, including hotlines among regional military as well as law-enforcement agency headquarters and operators, increased joint exercises for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and expanded information sharing networks.

The topic of regional security architecture was central to the objective of the Xiangshan Forum and to Xi Jinping’s new Asian Security Concept. Chinese dissatisfaction with the prevailing security system dominated by the United States was palpable. Although there was no clear alternative put forward, Chinese officials and scholars called for the creation of new structures that are strictly Asian, based on Asian needs, in accordance with Asian wisdom and efforts. They evidently hope that as China’s power grows, it will be able shape a regional security order that favors Chinese interests—one without U.S. alliances. In the years to come, the Xiangshan Forum will continue to seek to make a contribution to achieving this key objective.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Reviewing the First Year of China’s ADIZ: A Japanese Perspective</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When China’s Defense Ministry made an announcement of an “East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone” on November 23, 2013, the fundamental question was about its legal nature. The announcement provided that all aircraft, “regardless of its destination,” shall comply with the procedures within the ADIZ and that the Chinese military will take “defensive emergency measures” in case of non-compliance with its regulations. The texts of Chinese ADIZ regulations are similar to those of some other states, so it is necessary to review actual Chinese practices of the regulations to understand the real nature of China’s ADIZ.

There is little international law that provides legal foundation for Air Defense Identification Zones. Still, some states justify ADIZs as a measure only to control entry of aircraft into territorial airspace. In other words, it is contrary to the notion of freedom of overflight to take forcible measures against any aircraft which do not approach territorial airspace. For instance, the Japanese government defines its ADIZ as an airspace established to “facilitate measures against violation of territorial airspace, and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) is tasked to make scrambles only to identify unknown aircraft approaching Japanese territorial airspace.

In the case of the East China Sea, it is important to recognize the connection between airspace and water. It is widely known that China does not recognize the airspace above its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) as an international airspace contrary to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The outer limit of China’s ADIZ is almost identical to that of the Chinese claimed EEZ in the East China Sea. Therefore it is likely that China’s ADIZ is aimed at restricting foreign military aircraft’s freedom of overflight above its EEZ. Additionally, the May 24. 2014 harassment of Japanese surveillance aircraft (OP-3C and YS-11EB) by Chinese jet fighters (SU-27SK)in the airspace where Japanese and Chinese ADIZs overlap, indicates that China regards the ADIZ as an extension of territorial airspace. In this incident, Chinese fighters took dangerous maneuvers against Japanese aircraft approaching within 30 meters. Chinese officials justified this incident by criticizing Japanese aircraft’s “intrusion” into the ADIZ and a “no-fly zone” set during the China-Russia bilateral exercise. A similar incident occurred on June 11.

It is still too early to make a firm conclusion until Chinese practice in the ADIZ become clearer, however. In fact, China’s ADIZ still remains an ambitious dream due to China’s insufficient air domain awareness above the East China Sea. <a href="http://www.mod.go.jp/e/d_act/ryouku/">According to the Japanese Defense Ministry website</a>, Chinese aircraft generally fly only up to the median line of the East China Sea unless they are being escorted by early-warning aircraft. This flight pattern indicates the limitation of Chinese coastal radar coverage. Chinese radar may be able to detect Japanese aircraft flying higher such as OP-3C or YS-11EB but may not detect those flying lower such as P-3C.

Meanwhile, Japanese scrambles against Chinese aircraft continue to rise. Between October 2013 and September 2014, JASDF made 473 scrambles against Chinese aircraft—approximately a 23% increase from the previous year. Most of those Chinese aircraft were jet fighters from the PLA Air Force or Navy. This is why the establishment of crisis communication mechanism between Japan and China is urgent. Nevertheless, a Chinese military spokesman, condemning the frequency of Japanese “tailing, observing and interfering” with Chinese military aircraft as the cause of aviation safety problem, called on Japan to stop scrambling against Chinese aircraft.

Even after the meeting between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Xi Jinping on November 10, there is no sign of restraint in Chinese air activities approaching Japanese territorial airspace. Although the two leaders agreed to resume talks on a maritime communication mechanism, Tokyo and Beijing’s disagreements over scrambles and surveillance in East China Sea airspace are unlikely to be easily resolved.

		<title>China’s ADIZ at One Year: International Legal Issues</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This week marks a year since China abruptly declared an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) covering a large area of the East China Sea, including islands the legal possession of which China disputes with Japan. Especially because China has sent signals that it might enact another such zone in the South China Sea, this anniversary provides a moment to reflect on the international legality of the East China Sea ADIZ and international rules applicable to it. In general, China’s establishment of an ADIZ is not per se illegal as a matter of international law; however, the requirements China has declared for its East China Sea ADIZ are much broader than recent customary practice by others and China could enforce it in particular ways that would violate international law. Because international law does not yet have much to say about ADIZs, the practices worked out between China, the United States, Japan and others in this case will serve as important baselines for future ADIZs in Asia.

International law governing the status and limits of ADIZs – in which aircraft are usually required to submit flight plans and report their locations to national air traffic control – is not clear in any detailed way, though some well-established principles apply. Approximately two dozen countries (including the United States, Japan and Korea) maintain some form of ADIZ, generally for the purpose of defending against hostile intrusions of airspace or de-conflicting air traffic. So long as these zones are immediately adjacent to states’ own airspace, they are not very controversial. Indeed, by establishing clear patterns of behavior and requiring communication, they can be stabilizing. With no treaty that directly authorizes or regulates them and so little consistent state practice, however, it is hard to discern clear-cut and widely-recognized international rules for ADIZs.

Although there is no prohibition on ADIZs per se, they may be used in ways that violate other international legal provisions. The specific identification requirements declared by China go beyond typical ADIZs in that they apply to aircraft flying through the zone but not entering Chinese airspace (or even disputed airspace), and they apply to commercial aircraft as well as state (including military) aircraft, which are usually considered immune from regulation by other states.

An especially significant legal concern is that if China enforces its ADIZ in ways that prevents other states from freely transiting that airspace, it would violate freedom of overflight rights on the high seas. Customary international law and Article 87 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (or UNCLOS, to which China is a party) guarantee such overflight rights. In announcing its ADIZ a year ago, the Chinese defense agency implementing it declared that Chinese armed forces would adopt “defensive emergency measures” that did not cooperate with its administration of the zone. Such aggressive statements raised concerns that Chinese air forces might interfere with other states’ entitled overflight of international waters. So far, China’s enforcement practices are worrisome for their heightened risk of accidents or inadvertent crisis escalation – especially given overlapping territorial claims, and even overlapping ADIZs, in China’s ADIZ area – but it is debatable whether and to what extent they illegally interfere with free overflight.

Aggressive Chinese statements about “defensive measures” also contribute to perceptions that by instituting a consistent military presence there and by casting it in these terms, China may be attempting to establish over time a stronger claim to ownership over the contested islands below. That is, it could be to create facts in the sky to advance its bargaining position over disputed territory below. There is no basis in international law to derive rights to land by control of the skies above it, however.

The greatest danger of China’s move is not that it significantly reshapes the core territorial disputes. It is that expanded Chinese military patrols in the air, like its activities at sea, in such close proximity to those of rival players could lead to accidents, provocations, or miscommunications that might easily escalate. So as with maritime activities, for now diplomacy on air activities should focus on creating workable rules of the road and crisis communication mechanisms – and should not be distracted by claims that the ADIZ will substantially affect competing territorial claims. Non-binding codes of conduct would help mitigate dangers in the East China Sea ADIZ. They would also establish a template that could – in the absence of detailed, binding international law on this issue – be used elsewhere should China or other states establish additional zones, especially in other areas encompassing competing territorial claims like the South China Sea.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>China’s First ADIZ Decision: One Year Later</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[China’s Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) announcement on November 23, 2013 was one year ago, but frictions around the decision still remain. Tokyo insists that it rejects the ADIZ, and no Japanese civilian flights file their passage as requested. The United States has toned down its initial opposition, but no U.S. military planes obey Chinese demands of informing and identifying their routes prior to entry into Chinese ADIZ. Instead, following 2 strategic bombers’ unannounced intrusion on November 26, 2013, a good number of the intrusions continuously happen and the quite few of them are met with emergency interceptions through Chinese jet fighters scrambling. Nevertheless, it seems that China’s ADIZ setting is running like a “paper tiger” – Beijing has asked much but acts relatively little.

Yet, China’s ADIZ decision was not a gaffe. The decision holds weight for the Chinese PLA Air Force and Navy. First, China’s decision to declare its first ADIZ in the East China Sea signifies Beijing’s solid advancement of its air defense capability. Despite its self-restraint in enforcement, PLA may be proud that it ultimately made the step forward by adopting its own ADIZ after Japan, Korea, and Taiwan had declared their own. By proclaiming its ADIZ, the PLA Air Force was able to identify itself as an undeniable competitor in the West Pacific Ocean. The ADIZ is not an overt challenge the U.S. or Japan, but a clear proclamation of China’s extension of air defense coverage. China’s ADIZ, despite its controversy, has stood up under the formidable pressures of the United States, Japan, Australian and even Korea. Diplomatically, Beijing shows no sign that it will roll back or modify its decision. The United States labeled China as a “status quo changer”, and employed “muscle flexing” with the intrusion of two B-52 bombers last November, but Beijing cared little about these public statements or demonstration of might. Instead, Beijing may chuckle to itself because 60 commercial carriers have reported their routes of passage as China’s ADIZ asks for, including some U.S. carriers.

More importantly, China’s ADIZ decision keeps Japan under pressure. Given the vast overlapping area between the Chinese and Japanese ADIZs, Beijing now “legally” scrambles its jet fighters to move close to, and even encroach upon, Japanese surveillance planes in that air space. China-Japan territorial disputes over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands have escalated from the islands’ adjacent waters into air space contiguous to the Chinese coastline, where the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands are exactly located. Such a design is an intended one to put more pressures on the Abe Administration, which has rejected recognition of existing territorial disputes with Beijing. Japanese irritation is understandable, but China’s ADIZ has obviously enhanced its position in its contest with Tokyo over the sovereignty of these uninhabited islands.

In doing so, Beijing risks a great deal, as this could damage its ties with Tokyo and Washington. Furthermore, China’s ADIZ enforcement could result in an accidental air collision and even cause a military clash with Japan. That would truly be a disaster in East Asia. The ADIZ decision, however, has also revealed the Xi Jinping Administration’s serious resolve in wrestling with Japan over the disputed islands. Domestically, the ADIZ is conducive to Xi’s popularity.

One year after November 23, 2013, it is clear that Beijing does not want to be besieged with escalating tension simply due to its ADIZ decision. Nor does China have willingness to militarily coerce the disputed islands back, or overuse emergency aerial interceptions in its first ADIZ. China’s tough words on the ADIZ are a stark contrast to its actual, modest moves. But some low-intensity conflict over its ADIZ arguably satisfies Beijing’s presumed “squeezing tactic” on Tokyo. This is likely to continue unless Japan would rather alter its staunch position and recognize the existence of a Diaoyu/Senkaku dispute.

Moreover, with the ADIZ decision on the East China Sea, Beijing has managed to avoid damaging Cross-Strait relations – it did not cover Taiwan in its ADIZ and correctly calculated that the move would not disrupt ties with Taipei. The reality is that Taiwan’s KMT government also claims sovereignty over the islands although Taipei is not likely to align with Beijing in Diaoyu/Senkaku disputes. Because of significantly improved economic ties with the Mainland China, Taiwan expressed its concern over the ADIZ, but did not openly opposed it.

Nowadays, international curiosity has turned to whether China will declare an ADIZ in the South China Sea. Given the nature of concurrently choppy waters in the South China Sea, a new ADIZ decision would quite likely add to the tension. Beijing has not yet excluded the possibility of a South China Sea ADIZ. It seems unlikely that Beijing will make that decision soon, however. The reason for this is that there is no impending issue in the South China Sea that requires a new Chinese ADIZ at this time.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Treaty to End WWII For Russia and Japan?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Russian media reports that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged at a Monday meeting to do <a href="http://sputniknews.com/asia/20141201/1015335938.html">“whatever it takes”</a> to settle the Kuril Islands issue to conclude a peace treaty with
Russia. Russia and Japan have disagreed on the status of four islands since the end of World War II.

In the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338718-san-francisco-peace-treaty-1951.html">1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty</a>, Japan renounced its control over the Kuril Islands, as well as Taiwan, the Spratlys and Paracels, and <a href="http://amti.csis.org/timeline/#24">several other territories.</a> Japan and Russia disagree, however, over whether the four islands that Tokyo calls the Northern Territories—Etorofu-to, Kunashiri-to, Shikotan-to, and Habomai-shoto—were included in the “Kurile Islands” mentioned in the treaty. Tokyo maintains that these were not included and Moscow maintains that they were. Because of this disagreement, the Soviet Union declined to sign the San Francisco Treaty. The United States has since <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1371783-us-jpn-sept-7-1956-statement.html">recognized Japanese claims</a> to the islands.

Japan and the Soviet Union attempted to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1341867-int-joint-declaration-by-the-union-of-soviet.html">sign a treaty in 1956</a>, which would have acknowledged Japanese sovereignty over two of the four islands in question. The effort broke down due to disagreements over the attribution of the remaining two islands. Shinzo Abe has also <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/japans-shinzo-abe-tries-end-world-war-ii-11772">previously attempted</a> to resolve the Kuril issue with Russia, and in 2013 made the first visit by a Japanese Prime Minster to the Kremlin in over a decade. This diplomacy was derailed by Russian actions in Ukraine.

<a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/japan-s-abe-looks-to-settle-territorial-dispute-with-russia-over-kuril-islands/512416.html">
Russian reports cite</a> Japan’s Kyodo news agency as a source for Abe’s remarks. <a href="http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20141201/k10013618991000.html">Japanese news</a> sources affirm that <a href="http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20141201/k10013618991000.html">on December 1,</a> Abe restated his longstanding interest in solving the territorial issue, as does the <a href="http://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/96_abe/actions/201412/01hyoukei.html">Prime Minister’s office</a>, including <a href="http://japan.kantei.go.jp/96_abe/actions/201412/01article1.html">in one English translation</a>. No Japanese sources suggest that action is imminent, however, and Russian reporting may not have captured Abe's comments.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>South Korea’s Inevitable Expansion of its ADIZ</title>
		<link>http://amti.csis.org/south-koreas-inevitable-expansion-of-its-adiz/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In November 2013, China established an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the East China Sea. As a result of this action, the South Korean public became alerted to two significant issues that had previously been unintentionally ignored.

The first was the recognition of the strategic value of a part of the East China Sea, called the South Sea (<em>Namhae</em>) by the public in South Korea. The second was the realization that certain areas of Japan’s ADIZ (JADIZ) should be adjusted in accordance with relevant changes in international law and in cooperation with South Korea.

In the past, the attention of the South Korean public has primarily been focused on sporadic but persistent military provocations by North Korea along the Northern Limit Line (NLL) in the West Sea (<em>Seohae</em>)/Yellow Sea. Disputes have also arisen between China and South Korea over the sea areas surrounding a submerged maritime feature called <em>Ieodo</em> by South Korea. <em>Ieodo</em> is located in South Korea’s part of the hypothetical equidistance line between both countries’ Exclusive Economic Zones. China and South Korea agreed that since the dispute is not about territorial sovereignty, but is related to maritime jurisdiction, it can be resolved through negotiations on maritime delimitation. This is due to the fact that <em>Ieodo</em> is a submerged rock and therefore not subject to a territorial sovereignty claim.

This agreed ROK-PRC understanding, however, seemed to have been challenged by the fact that the airspace over the sea areas was included in the China’s newly established ADIZ. International lawyers generally understood that the ADIZ had nothing to do with strengthening any claim over territorial sovereignty, but the word “defense” in the zone’s name was enough to provide confusion to the public and even experts on national security. Thus, the South Korean public concluded that the strategic value of the South Sea <em>(Namhae)</em> should be reassessed because of the perceived threat of China’s ADIZ to national defense and security.

In addition, the South Korean public realized that the airspace over the sea areas surrounding <em>Ieodo</em> was in Japan’s ADIZ and not in the South Korea’s ADIZ (KADIZ). This might have led to deepening public mistrust towards Japan. However, due to the explanations of the government and media, such problematic suspicions never materialized. The KADIZ and JADIZ were created before the adoption of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea that established the 12 nautical mile territorial sea and 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone regime. At the time when both ADIZs were established, the waters surrounding <em>Ieodo</em> were not under national jurisdiction but considered part of the high seas.

Additional suspicions might have arisen in some parts of the 12 nautical mile territorial sea from South Korea’s islands, <em>Hongdo</em> and <em>Marado.</em> Since at the time of the establishments of the JADIZ and the KADIZ a state could delimit its territorial sea up to 3 nautical miles only, the parts of the territorial sea beyond the 3 nautical miles from the two islands to 12 nautical miles were not parts of the South Korea’s territorial sea, thereby being located in the Japan’s ADIZ. To rectify all these contradictions and controversies due to the change of relevant international law, South Korea inevitably extended its ADIZ, which entered into force on December 15, 2013. The current overlapping ADIZ zones between Japan and South Korea, therefore, should not be understood as a conflict, but a matter of adjustment, unlike the overlapping zones between China and South Korea.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a sign of growing congressional concern about China’s increased assertiveness in the South and East China seas, Congress has included a provision in the draft fiscal year 2015 National Defense Authorization Act requiring the Department of Defense to report to key congressional committees an assessment of China’s moves to affect the current state of affairs in these disputed seas.

The provision calls on the Defense Department, within 180 days, to provide an unclassified report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee on China’s actions to change the status quo with regard to competing territorial and maritime claims in the two seas. Congress has also required the Pentagon to report on the implications of China’s moves for U.S. security interests in Asia.

This provision marks an increase in congressional interest in Asia’s maritime disputes by imposing concrete requirements on the administration. Previous congressional expressions of frustration about China’s actions took the form congressional hearings and non-binding resolutions such as the one passed by the House of Representatives on December 4. This resolution called for disputes in the South China Sea to be resolved by peaceful means using international law and through negotiating a code of conduct between China and the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

Vietnam and the Philippines, two countries in a dispute with China in the South China Sea, charge Beijing with taking provocative actions in recent years to enforce its territorial and maritime claims. China rejects these charges and says it is responding to unilateral steps by Vietnam and the Philippines to boost their claims and indicts the United States for meddling in the territorial disputes to undermine Beijing’s influence in the region. Washington insists it does not take sides in the disputes, but urges all parties to avoid unilateral and provocative actions to change the status quo.

In the East China Sea, where Tokyo and Beijing have overlapping claims, Chinese ships and planes have repeatedly faced off against Japanese vessels and aircraft in recent years.

The draft authorization bill calls on the Pentagon to assess China’s maritime strategies and capabilities, including Chinese anti-access and area denial strategies, and how these affect U.S. strategy in the Asia-Pacific. Congress also asks the Defense Department for a description of ongoing and planned changes in U.S. military capabilities in the region.

The draft bill requests an annual briefing on military-to-military engagements between the United States and China and how these exchanges will “reduce the potential for miscalculation and tensions in the South China Sea and the East China Sea.” It also asks for a detailed description of “all planned and potential military-to-military engagements” between the United States and China in the subsequent 12 months.

This increased congressional attention will make clear to the Pentagon that it has the strong backing of Congress to monitor and respond to China’s assertive actions in the Asia-Pacific’s two largest maritime disputes.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Assessing U.S. Policy in the South China Sea</title>
		<link>http://amti.csis.org/assessing-u-s-policy-in-the-south-china-sea/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A recent <a href="C:\Users\mrapp-hooper\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary%20Internet Files\Content.Outlook\DWU3H27I\SCS Policy Final IOP-2014-U-009109.pdf">CNA Corporation report</a> assessed current U.S. policy on the South China Sea and found it to be comprehensive and balanced. United States policy focuses on creating stability by exhorting all parties to follow the rules of international law. It also explicitly defines how Washington would like conflicts to be solved. Moreover, it includes hard-power initiatives, such as rotationally stationing U.S. Navy warships in Singapore, the new military access agreement with the Philippines, the partial lifting of the arms embargo against Vietnam, and collaboration with Manila on improving its naval capacity. These are aimed at improving U.S. naval and air posture close to the South China Sea as well as redressing some of the capabilities imbalances between the Philippines, Vietnam, and China. Finally, it incorporates elements of traditional deterrence by affirming America’s security alliance with the Philippines.

On the other hand, U.S. policy implicitly acknowledges that the South China Sea is not the central strategic element in the overall U.S.-China relationship. The South China Sea was clearly not the centerpiece of the November 2014 Obama-Xi summit in Beijing: climate change, North Korea, Taiwan, trade and cyber issues were the focuses of this exchange. Our CNA study endorses this issue hierarchy, and argues that, in practice, U.S. South China Sea policy should not be overwhelmingly anti-Chinese. The United States should criticize Chinese behavior, along with the behavior of American friends and allies, when warranted. Finally, when it comes to the South China Sea, Washington should not bluff. In other words it should not announce policies it is not prepared to back-up.

The United States should reinforce its existing policy that international law is the basis for rules-based stability by issuing a comprehensive white paper on the various aspects of international law that are being abused by China and other claimants in the South China Sea. Because the focus on international law has been such a centerpiece of U.S. policy, this authoritative document should be signed by the Secretary of State and given appropriate publicity.

U.S. officials have publicly supported the Philippines’ request for arbitration, but if the arbitral tribunal rules that it does not have jurisdiction over this case, it will be a major setback and quash hopes that international law can be the basis for shaping the behavior of parties involved in South China Sea disputes. The Department of State should publicly highlight the importance of allowing the Philippines to have “its day in court,” for the sake of resolving the Philippines-PRC dispute and for the important precedent this arbitration may set.

Among several other policy recommendations in the report, our findings support efforts to help South Sea littoral states help themselves through improvements in surveillance, command and control, and policing of their respective maritime domains. The United States also needs to be completely committed to a very long term, dedicated effort to improve the Armed Forces of the Philippine’s maritime capabilities. Both sides need to agree on what constitutes an AFP “minimum credible deterrent,” and enact a plan to achieve it.

When it comes to U.S. posture, our CNA report recommends that naval and air presence in the South China Sea should be a visible, daily occurrence. To that end, increasing the duration, a defacto increase in operational presence, of U.S. exercises with South China Sea littoral states and expanding them by inviting participation from other Asian maritime states, such as Japan, Australia, South Korea, and possibly India, will illustrate that other maritime states are concerned about stability in the South China Sea.

Finally, Washington should ensure that planned U.S. military posture and capability improvements in East Asia are portrayed as symbols of reassurance and stability-oriented presence and are not characterized as attempts to confront China directly. Policymakers should emphasize that the objective of the military portion of the administration’s Rebalance strategy is to ensure that the United States can fulfil security responsibilities to U.S. allies and friends because it is capable of assured access whenever and wherever it may be required.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Land Reclamation: A South China Sea Game Changer</title>
		<link>http://amti.csis.org/land-reclamation-a-south-china-sea-game-changer/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It is widely reported that China is conducting land reclamation on six of its seven occupied features in the Spratlys in the South China Sea, transforming the submerged reefs and rocks into full-pledged islands with airstrips, harbors and other military and civilian structures. Once reclamation works are completed, Fiery Cross Reef alone will be <a href="http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?cid=1101&amp;MainCatID=11&amp;id=20141021000087">at least two square kilometres</a> in size - as large as all other islands in the Spratlys are combined.

Chinese officials and scholars have cited several reasons to justify Beijing’s strategic move including a need for improved search and rescue capability in the South China Sea, a desire to improve the working and living conditions of Chinese nationals working there, and a need for a base to support China's <a href="http://ajw.asahi.com/article/asia/china/AJ201411230018">radar and intelligence system</a>. Chinese representatives have complained on various occasions that it is unfair to point the finger at China as other SCS claimants have already engaged in reclamation activities and China is the last of claimants to have airstrips there.

Whatever the reasons are, Chinese unprecedented large-scale land reclamation works, once finished, will tremendously impact the dynamics of the claimants' contest and major powers' competition in the South China Sea.

Chinese fishing squads, which already enjoy<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/28/us-southchinasea-china-fishing-insight-idUSKBN0FW0QP20140728"> financial, technical, and administrative support</a> from central and local governments, can utilize facilities on the enlarged islands to extend the duration and scope of their fishing activities, which will most likely stoke tensions with other claimants as they intrude into the exclusive economic zones of Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia and court confrontation with those countries' fishermen and law enforcement forces.

The enlarged islands with airstrips and harbors could arguably strengthen Chinese coercive capabilities, allowing China to quickly and extensively deploy its military, paramilitary and pseudo-civilian vessels and aircrafts to the central and southern parts of the South China Sea in case of confrontation with other claimants.

<a href="http://www.janes.com/article/46083/china-building-airstrip-capable-island-on-fiery-cross-reef">Jane's Defence Weekly</a> considers Chinese facilities on the enlarged islands as “purpose-built to coerce other claimants into relinquishing their claims and possessions.” It is unlikely that other claimants will ever relinquish their claims and possessions in the Spratlys; nevertheless, those facilities could arguably enhance Chinese capabilities to block the supply routes of Vietnam, Philippines to their controlled islands and rocks there. China's attempts to block Philippine supplying routes to the <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/03/second-thomas-shoal-tensions-intensify/">Second Thomas Shoal</a> in the first half of 2014 well illustrate this point.

On a brighter side, it might be argued that possession of large islands with sophisticated military and civilian facilities that could cater to all its needs would decrease the incentives for China to attack islands controlled by others.

Different from other claimants’ presence on the Spratlys, which is aimed at demonstrating effective administration of their currently controlled islands by maintaining airstrips that can assist in supplying those islands, China’s expanded military presence there could serve to enhance Chinese power projection capability in, if not control of, the South China Sea. The <a href="http://csis.org/files/attachments/140807_Koda.pdf">web of Chinese military bases</a> in the South China Sea, connecting Sanya in Hainan Island in the north to Woody Island in the Paracels in the west to new unsinkable aircraft carriers in Fiery Cross, Johnson South, Cuateron and Gaven Reefs in the Spratlys in the center and the south, and possible bases in the Mischief Reef and Scarborough Shoal in the east, will enhance Chinese capability to enforce an air defense identification zone above the South China Sea if and when established, harass U.S. military activities in and above the sea, hunt for American submarines, <a href="http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/construction-of-an-airfield-on-the-disputed-spratly-islands-puts-australia-in-reach-of-chinas-strategic-bombers-reports/story-fnpjxnlk-1227133763994">place Australia within Chinese strategic bombers' range</a> for the first time, and control or at least send a deterrent message of Chinese capability in blocking the critical energy supply routes from the Middle East to Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.

From an international law perspective, <a href="http://cil.nus.edu.sg/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Beckman-RSIS-Commentary-of-Reclamation-in-SCS-CO14213-29Oct2014.pdf">commentators have already highlighted</a> that China’s reclamation works constitutes a breach of international agreements, which require all parties to exercise restraint and not undertake unilateral actions that would permanently change the status quo regarding the disputed areas. Insofar as Chinese dredging and constructing activities are <a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-11-27/victims-under-the-south-china-sea">damaging the coral system in the Spratlys</a>, they are also indicative of China’s disregard for ‘duty to cooperate’ with other environmentally affected States. Furthermore, these activities are inconsistent with the 2002 ASEAN-China Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, which calls on all parties to refrain from activities that would complicate or escalate the disputes. In presenting others states with a new 'fait accompli' during the <a href="http://www.thaiembdc.org/dcdp/?q=node/478">negotiation for an ASEAN-China Code of Conduct</a> in the South China Sea – one of the main purposes of which is to keep the status quo of the South China Sea, China is dashing any hope for a meaningful document that can help govern this troubled maritime area.

So far, three countries - <a href="http://www.thanhniennews.com/politics/land-reclamation-further-complicates-east-sea-issue-vietnam-says-33996.html">Vietnam</a>, the <a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/114825/ph-files-diplomatic-protest-vs-china-airstrip/">Philippines </a>and the <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2014/11/234366.htm#.VHfwzQ62LWU.twitter">United States</a> - have protested China’s reclamation activities, but clearly diplomatic protests alone have little impact on China’s will and calculations. A Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry official has bluntly <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/04/us-china-southchinasea-idUSKBN0G40UI20140804">stated </a>that China can carry out whatever construction in the reefs that are within its “sovereignty.”

Given the enormous stakes at peril and a wide range of affected parties, a concerted effort by all littoral states and stakeholders is more than urgent to prevent this common sea from permanently becoming anybody's lake before it is all too late.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Fiery Cross Reef and Strategic Implications for Taiwan</title>
		<link>http://amti.csis.org/fiery-cross-reef-and-the-strategic-implications-for-taiwan/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[According to a satellite imagery reported by IHS Jane’s Defence Weekly, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is building an airstrip on of Fiery Cross Reef. The United States, Philippines, and Vietnam have all voiced official objections to PRC activities. Unsurprisingly, PRC officials dismiss these criticisms, arguing that Fiery Cross Reef development is intended to improve the living and working conditions of search and rescue workers, and noting that many other claimants have airstrips in the Spratlys.

Notably, however, Taiwan, which generally does not challenge PRC activities in the South China Sea, also responded to the Chinese land reclamation activities by repeating its sovereignty claim over the disputed islands the South China Sea. This includes the four large archipelagos: the Pratas Islands, Paracel lands, Macclesfield Bank, and Spratly Islands. It also echoed the U.S. government's latest call on all claimants to exercise self-restraint and help reduce tensions in the region. In addition, as pointed out by Lin Yu-fang, a Taiwanese legislator with the Kuomintang Party, the Chinese land reclamation activities pose a national security threat to Taiwan.

Fiery Cross Reef is one of six land features that the PRC occupied in 1988 and has been under its effective control over the past 26 years. In addition to the PRC, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam also claim territorial sovereignty over the reef. With the exception of two small rocks, the entire Fiery Cross Reef is covered by the water at high tide. Under international law, no states are allowed to claim sovereignty over geographical features that are submerged under water. In addition, under UNCLOS, land features that are surrounded by and above water at low tide but submerged at high tide are considered low-tide elevation. A low-tide elevation has no territorial sea of its own if it is wholly situated at a distance exceeding the breadth of territorial sea from the mainland or an island.

As a result of PRC reclamation activities, an artificial island was built on Fiery Cross Reef, with a size of 0.0081 square km (90 meters long and 90 meters wide). It was reported on November 23, 2014 that the size of the reef had reached to 1.37 square km and it could become larger.

Taiwan does not explicitly challenge the Chinese activities for three reasons. First, both Taipei and Beijing recognize that there is only one “China” - both mainland China and Taiwan belong to the same China, but both sides agree to interpret the meaning of that “one China” according to their own individual definition. Beijing’s South China Sea claims are based on Taipei’s. And because Taipei and Beijing claim that the Spratly Islands belong to “China,” it would be contradictory if Taiwan asks PRC to stop land reclamation activities on Fiery Cross Reef. Second, Taiwan is also undertaking a wharf facilities expansion project on Taiping Island (Itu Aba), which is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2015. The wharf can accommodate larger coast guard cutters and navy supply ships. The project also includes air navigation and landing systems and possible extension of the runway in the future. The construction work is to strengthen Taiwan’s defense capability and for the purpose of asking the parties concerned to include Taipei, one of the stakeholders, in regional security dialogues that discuss the South China Sea issue.

Third, the two “rocks”, located in the southwestern and northeastern edge of Fiery Cross Reef, while small and barren, are consistent with the Regime of Islands (Article 121 of UNCLOS), because they are “naturally formed area[s] of land, surrounded by water, which [are] above water at high tide.” As such, the two rocks of the reef are entitled to a 12 nautical mile territorial sea and 24 nautical mile contiguous zone. Whether or not the two rocks generate a 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) or continental shelf depends on the interpretation of UNCLOS.

Although Taiwan does not directly challenge the Chinese land reclamation activities in the Spratlys, it does express great concern about the potential threat posed by land reclamation. In addition to the airstrip construction, it is believed that the reef could also be used as an electronic surveillance base. At the Xiangshan Forum, a national security dialogue held on November 20-22, 2014 in Beijing, Jin Zhirui of the Chinese Air Force Headquarters said: “There is a need for a base to support our radar system and intelligence-gathering activities” in the Spratly Islands.

The construction of a major base on Fiery Cross Reef has the potential to upend the strategic structure in the Spratly Islands. It could also tip the balance of power in South China Sea territorial and maritime disputes in PRC’s favor. If a line is drawn in the Spratly archipelago, starting from Spratly Island and extending in the direction from southwest to northeast to reach Thitu Island, Fiery Cross Reef is located in the middle of this line. After the airstrip is built on the reef and military facilities are installed on other occupied reefs the PLA Air Force and Navy will be able to project power further down south to the center part of the South China Sea in the Spratly area would have profound impact on not only military planning of the claimant states in the sea but also other countries concerned such as the United States, Japan, and India.

Vietnam occupied Spratly Island and built a 610-meter long runway in 1973. The Philippines took Thitu Island in 1971 and added a 1,300-meter long runway four years later. Southwest of Thitu lies Taiping Island, the largest of the Spratly archipelago, and the only one with fresh water in the area, which has been under Republic of China’s effective control since 1956 and has a 1,200-meter runway. Along the line (see map below) there are five notable land features, all of which were taken by the PRC in 1988: Subi Reef, Gaven Reef, Hughes Reef, McKennan Reef, and Cuarteron Reef. Land reclamation activities are also undertaken on these reefs by the PRC. It was reported that helipad will be built and helicopters will be deployed on Cuarteron Reef.

The strategic advantages of an airstrip on Fiery Cross Reef include a base for reconnaissance aircraft and unmanned system, shorter resupply routes, and a basis for anti-submarine warfare equipment. For the PRC, this land feature could fulfill the strategic role of an “unsinkable aircraft carrier.” In addition, the PRC’s strategic reach could extend from Sanya nuclear submarine base in Hainan to Woody Island of the Paracel archipelago, and then further south to Fiery Cross Reef of the Spratly Islands. Taiwan is also heavily dependent upon importation by sea of fuel, food and other materials, so the security of sea lines of communication is of prime importance to Taipei.

The PRC has claimed a disadvantage vis-à-vis the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia, because it is the only country without an island-based runway in the Spratlys. After Taiwan built an airstrip on the largest island in the Spratly archipelago, Beijing had made efforts to seek cooperation with Taipei on maritime interests in the South China Sea, including possible use of Taiwan’s facilities on Taiping Island, but without avail. Due to security and foreign policy considerations as well as policy pressure and concern from the U.S. government, the Ma Ying-jeou administration has made its position clear that Taiwan will not cooperate with PRC on issues related to South China Sea territorial disputes.

After the completion of the Chinese land reclamation projects on Fiery Cross Reef, the strategic importance of Taiwan’s Taiping Island will decline. The need for Beijing to seek permission from Taiwan for possible use of Taiping Island or Cross-Strait cooperation in the Spratly Islands is on the wane. At the same time, it is possible that that the PRC may take action against Taiping Island for the purpose of pushing Taiwan to move closer to Beijing’s policy agenda. This includes calls for Cross-Strait dialogue and efforts to deter Taiwan from moving toward independence or abandoning the U-shaped (11-dash) line claim in the South China Sea, which may be possibilities if there is a DPP victory in Taiwan’s 2016 presidential election.

		<title>Paper Melee in Philippines v. China Arbitration</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today’s deadline for the submission of China’s counter-memorial in the Philippines v. China arbitration has created a four-cornered melee of positions papers over one of the key issues in dispute, the legality of China’s nine-dash line claim.

The United States weighed in first on December 5th with the release of its <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/234936.pdf">Limits in the Seas</a> paper, declaring the nine-dash line to be internationally acceptable only as a claim to islands within the line; any maritime zones within the lines must be in accordance with UNCLOS. This necessarily criticized China’s ambiguity about the lines and denied the validity of more extensive claims to historic title or historic rights that it sometimes expressed directly or through advocates.

Two days later, China released its <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-12/07/content_19037946.htm">position paper</a> on the arbitration, legally contesting the jurisdiction of the tribunal in public without participating in the proceedings. It reiterated that the dispute was essentially founded on the issue of territorial sovereignty over islands and features in the South China Sea, and that even if the tribunal could disregard the sovereignty questions, it could not decide on the Philippine claims without first undertaking maritime delimitations. China argues that either way, the dispute is outside the Annex VII tribunal’s jurisdiction. China further argues that contrary to its claims, the Philippines had not actually undertaken prior negotiations on the subject of the case, and that it was effectively acting in bad faith and abusing its rights by dragging China into an arbitration proceeding contrary to every state’s right to choose the means of dispute settlement. Notably, China avoided any detail on the substance of the nine-dashed line and referred to it only incidentally.

Meanwhile, Vietnam had quietly submitted a statement of its own to the tribunal, a fact announced <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.vn/en/tt_baochi/pbnfn/ns141212143709">only on December 11</a>. Though the statement itself has not yet been publicly released, Vietnam’s foreign ministry said that it had requested the tribunal to pay due regard to the legal rights and interests of Vietnam. Vietnam reportedly also supports the Philippines by recognizing the tribunal’s jurisdiction over the case, and contesting the legal basis of China’s nine –dash line. Few other details are available as to the precise content and scope of Vietnam’s statement.

The clashing positions undoubtedly create challenging questions for the tribunal to consider at this stage in the proceedings. The Philippines would have undoubtedly attempted to anticipate China’s principal objections in the memorial it filed last March, and submitted arguments why the arbitration can proceed regardless of the pending disputes over sovereignty over any islands, rocks and reefs, and why the claims do not require maritime boundary delimitations. However, China’s arguments that prior negotiations were inadequate and that resort to arbitration essentially constitutes bad faith and an abuse of process appear to be relatively novel and deserve a response from the Philippines. They may also require a closer review of any documentary evidence submitted by the Philippines on all relevant prior discussions, which may raise other questions for the tribunal.

While the US position on the nine-dash line is consistent with the underlying theory of the Philippine case, it also impliedly raises questions as to whether maritime boundary delimitations within the area of the nine-dash lines are absolutely necessary and unavoidable before the Philippine claims can be decided.

Vietnam’s submission may be critical. Although it made a statement, it has not necessarily intervened formally in the proceedings, and its request for due regard to its legal rights and interests could be taken either as a license to continue without prejudice, or an obstacle due to the absence of an indispensable third party in the proceedings. This necessarily depends on the precise content of Vietnam’s statement, and the tribunal’s appreciation of the impact of Vietnam’s own occupation of features in the SCS on the claims of the Philippines against the Chinese installations and activities. These could affect many of the Philippines’ claims, apart from the issue of the legality of the nine-dash line.

In light of these developments, the tribunal is now very likely to require at least a written submission, if not a hearing on oral arguments, of the Philippines in order to thresh out the complicated and interrelated preliminary questions raised by these submissions. And this does not yet consider whether, after the preliminary questions are satisfactorily answered, the tribunal will require further oral arguments, reception of additional evidence, or the engagement of expert third-party for additional input on the merits. All these will probably push the timetable of the arbitration proceedings to occupy most of 2015. These maneuvers have underlined the complexities involved in legally resolving the South China Sea disputes.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Beijing’s and Washington’s Dueling Papers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Beijing has reached its December 15 deadline to submit its defense in the arbitration case against its South China Sea claims brought by the Philippines. That case, brought under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea’s (UNCLOS) compulsory dispute mechanism, is <a href="http://csis.org/publication/manila-begins-legal-proceedings-over-south-china-sea-claims">summarized here</a>. The Chinese government has no intention of taking part in it, or refuting the Philippines’ 4,000 pages of evidence and arguments, but it has made sure that the five judges hearing the case in the Permanent Court of Arbitration take China’s arguments against their jurisdiction into account.

To that end, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on December 7 released a <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1217147.shtml">position paper</a> laying out China’s legal objections to the case. Two days earlier the U.S. State Department released a <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/234936.pdf">long-awaited analysis</a> of the legality of Beijing’s South China Sea claims through its Limits in the Sea series. The timing of these two releases, both in relation to each other and to the next stage of the arbitration case, suggest that policymakers in Beijing and Washington recognize the value of occupying the legal high ground in the South China Sea and are eager to influence the arbitral tribunal even if they are not directly engaging in the case.

<strong>What does China’s position paper say?</strong>

The core of the Chinese position paper lays out Beijing’s arguments for why the arbitral tribunal at The Hague lacks jurisdiction in the Philippines’ case. China contends that:
<ul>
	<li>At its heart the case is not about interpreting UNCLOS, but about territorial sovereignty—who owns what features— over which UNCLOS has no jurisdiction. This argument is not compelling, at least not in China’s formulation that to rule on any of the Philippines’ points, the court “would inevitably have to determine, directly or indirectly, the sovereignty over both the maritime features in question and other maritime features in the South China Sea.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Even if the case were about UNCLOS, the Philippines had no right to bring it. China argues that the Philippines bound itself in both bilateral statements and especially in the 2002 ASEAN-China Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) to only resolve disputes through negotiation. Whether or not any such binding obligation was made is highly suspect, but Manila could easily argue that Chinese violations have nullified the DOC regardless.China also argues that the Philippines has not met the UNCLOS requirement to only pursue compulsory arbitration after failing to reach a bilateral accord. Beijing insists that despite decades of discussions, “the two countries have never engaged in negotiations with regard to the subject-matter of the arbitration,” and even if they did, UNCLOS does not specify a time limit for such negotiations. If accepted, this line of reasoning would preclude a country from ever using compulsory dispute resolution no matter how long another claimant stonewalls discussions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Even if Manila did have the right, China is exempted from compulsory arbitration. This is Beijing’s most compelling argument. It rests on China’s 2006 declaration, as allowed by UNCLOS, that it is exempt from arbitration on certain topics including maritime delimitation. The Philippines has done an admirable job of framing its case as being about China’s obligation to clarify the nine-dash line and about the status of features, not about delimiting disputed waters.But Manila’s argument is not a slam dunk. Most worrying for the Philippines is that its lawyers felt compelled to include an argument about the status of Itu Aba, the largest of the Spratly Islands, in its March 30 submissions to the court. Were the tribunal to rule Itu Aba (or any other feature) an island legally capable of generating a continental shelf, then it would likely undermine parts of the Philippine case, especially those pertaining to low-tide elevations. But it is noteworthy that China’s position paper does not detail this point, leaving it to the arbitral judges to connect the dots.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Even if China were not exempt, the use of a special arbitral tribunal in cases in which a state has not selected one of the other options for arbitration permitted by UNCLOS violates international law. This is essentially questioning an UNCLOS provision to which China agreed in 1996. It is the least compelling of China’s arguments, not least because it is hard to fathom that a court established under the provisions of UNCLOS would feel empowered to overturn the only sensible interpretation of one of those provisions.</li>
</ul>
It is telling that amid its arguments against the court’s jurisdiction, China also touches on the merits of the case (despite insisting in the introduction that it will not do so). In particular, it makes an argument about the ability of a state to make a claim of sovereignty over a low-tide elevation, despite acknowledging that the International Court of Justice in 2012 ruled that such a claim is not permissible. China also defends its actions at Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal since 2012, which the Philippines describe as employing the threat of force. Yet the position paper does not address either the status of those features the Philippines identifies as rocks rather than islands, nor does it defend the nine-dash line as a claim to maritime space in accord with UNCLOS—both indicative of the weakness of China’s legal position on those points.

<strong>What does the U.S. study say?</strong>

The State Department’s Limits in the Sea studies have in the past examined the maritime claims of dozens of nations, including Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. The latest report does not touch on the validity of territorial claims over islands in the South China Sea, reiterating the U.S. position of neutrality.

The study’s main finding is that “China has not clarified…the legal basis or nature of its claim.” The study points out that the nine-dash line lacks “geographical consistency and precision,” which it underscores by overlaying several Chinese maps showing significant variation in the placement of the dashes. It offers some support for aspects of the Philippine case covering Chinese-occupied rocks and low-tide elevations. At its core, the analysis offers a refutation of the nine-dash line as a valid maritime claim, and thus aligns with the heart of the Philippines’ case.

The State Department presents three possible interpretations of the nine-dash line and analyzes their legality. Each of these interpretations are simultaneously supported and contradicted by various Chinese legislation and official pronouncements:
<ul>
	<li>A claim to islands and the waters they would generate. The study finds that this could be a legally consistent definition of the nine-dash line but points out that it has major caveats. For one, “states and international courts and tribunals typically accord very small islands far from a mainland coast…equal or less weight than opposing coastlines.” This means that China could at best justify an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) extending to a median line between its claimed islands and its Southeast Asian neighbors’ coastlines.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>A maritime boundary. The State Department points out that the nine-dash line extends too far beyond any coastline or island to be legally justifiable as the boundary of an EEZ, and certainly not territorial waters. The study also charges that the claim’s lack of precision and unilateral declaration fail to meet the basic requirements of a legal maritime boundary.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>A claim to historic title or rights. This is the most complicated of the legal justifications put forward by Chinese scholars regarding the nine-dash line. The State Department rightly points out that UNCLOS “limits the relevance of historic claims to bays and territorial sea delimitation” near a nation’s coast. Nothing in the convention justifies a historical claim of sovereignty or extensive rights far from a coastline.And contrary to some Chinese scholars’ assertions that customary law predating UNCLOS would allow such a claim, the State Department rightly insists that the convention takes precedence. To prove the point, it cites the International Court of Justice’s ruling that the advent of EEZs “overrides the prior usage and rights of other States in that area”—a clear refutation of China’s claims to historic rights over fisheries and hydrocarbons.</li>
</ul>
<strong>What is next for the arbitration tribunal?</strong>

China will not submit anything on December 15 in response to the tribunal’s deadline. This means the judges will take it upon themselves to consider the counterarguments that Beijing would have made. This is why the Chinese position paper’s release is so important. It has been timed to ensure that the judges ask the right questions, from China’s perspective. Experts in China know that Beijing will lose on at least one point if the case goes the distance. The nine-dash line in its current form does not meet any of the requirements of a legal maritime claim—a point the new U.S. study underscores—and requires clarification.

That is why China, even while refusing to officially take part in the proceedings, has invested considerable energy in developing a legal case against jurisdiction. Despite its bluster, Beijing does not want to flout an international tribunal’s ruling and incur the opportunity costs that come with being seen as an irresponsible player in the international system.

As a next step, the court will ask the Philippine legal team to respond to questions and possible objections regarding its March submission. Those questions will likely cover many of the points raised in China’s position paper, among others, since the judges will not rule on such a high-profile and controversial case unless they feel it is airtight.

Once the Philippines responds—a task that will take several months—the judges will consider the questions of jurisdiction and merits in the case. They seem ready to consider both at once, which should speed up the proceedings. There is no set timetable for a decision, and there might be more than one request to the Philippines for clarification of points. But by late 2015, and perhaps earlier, the court should make its decision—potentially the most impactful by any tribunal established under UNCLOS.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Taiwan’s local elections of 2014 were held on November 29 and elected 6 municipal mayors and 16 county magistrates. The KMT (Kuomintang, Nationalist Party), Taiwan’s ruling party, won only 6 out of the 22 local seats and gained just 40.7 percent of the vote. Jiang Yi-huah, Taiwan’s premier, resigned after election. President Ma Ying-jeou also stepped down as the chairman of the KMT to take responsibility for his party's losses in the elections. The Democratic Progress Party (DPP), Taiwan’s opposing party, won a landslide over the KMT and raised the prospects of the party’s victory in Taiwan’s upcoming 2016 presidential election.

The 2014 elections, being local in nature, did not touch upon the South China Sea issue or Taiwan’s position on the U-shaped line. However, since February 2014, Taiwan has received increasing calls from foreign countries to clarify its intentions with respect to <a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1347513-prc-img-eleven-dotted-line-1947.html">the 1947 line</a> and its sovereignty and maritime claims in the South China Sea. It is under pressure to bring these into accordance with international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

In September 2014, Parris Chang, Taiwan’s former National Security Council deputy secretary-general, stated that if the DPP wins the 2016 presidential election, it would seriously consider abandoning its claims to the entire South China Sea that is based on the U-shaped line. In response to this statement, an op-ed article published by the Global Times warned that “<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/883219.shtm">Taiwan abandoning nine-dash line in South China Sea would be disastrous</a>.”

Particularly if the South China Sea arbitral tribunal makes its ruling in 2015, it can be expected that the South China Sea dispute, Taiwan’s position on the U-shaped line, and cross-strait maritime cooperation would become important issues to be debated by presidential candidates from the KMT and DPP when the campaign begins in 2015.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What is Japan’s Shangri-La Dialogue Initiative?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani proposed a “Shangri-La Dialogue Initiative” (SDI) at this year’s Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore. To build foundation for deeper security collaboration with regional partners, Nakatani proposed crisis management though the promotion of common rules and law in the maritime and air domains, maritime and air security through the enhancement of regional maritime domain awareness (MDA), and confidence-building through the improvement of regional disaster response capability.

&nbsp;

Nakatani proposed the SDI after explaining the new U.S.-Japan Defense Guidelines and the on-going national security legislation reform. Japan has played an important role in South China Sea issues, particularly in terms of capacity building. As its role is expected to expand under the new Guidelines and legislation, the SDI indicates how Japan will expand its engagement in the troubled waters of the South China Sea.

&nbsp;

The SDI is a follow-up of the “three principles for the rule of law,” proposed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the 2014 Shangri-La Dialogue. In view of rising territorial and maritime tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, Abe called for countries to make and clarify claims based on international law, to avoid using force or coercion in resolving conflicts, and to seek to settle disputes by peaceful means. Putting these three principles of the rule of law into practice is essential for the stability of the Indo-Pacific region. In reality, however, there is no consensus on the legal basis for maritime boundaries in postwar Asia. The national sea boundaries in Asia are based on the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty signed between Japan and 48 other countries, but those countries not party to this treaty are not bound by its provisions.

&nbsp;

There is no universal interpretation of the law of sea, either. Interpretations of the law of the sea vary by country, for example, on the extent to which coastal countries can restrict the innocent passage of foreign vessels through territorial waters and on whether coastal countries possess jurisdiction in terms of security within exclusive economic zones. These disagreements have at times sparked diplomatic confrontation and precarious encounters between military forces.

&nbsp;

There is, therefore, a pressing need for crisis management, MDA, and confidence-building to maintain good order at sea. This is why the SDI calls for those measures. A crisis management mechanism must be established in the region to avoid miscalculation and control escalation. Japan and China are about to agree on maritime/air communication mechanism between defense authorities. The next step is to establish a code of conduct in the maritime and air domains. Similar efforts are being made between the United States and China, and between ASEAN and China. These efforts are designed to manage crises through the application of existing international law (UNCLOS) and international rules (such as COLREGS and CUES). If they prove successful, they will contribute substantially to establishing the rule of law in Asian seas.

&nbsp;

Crisis management at sea is difficult without knowing what is going on over the horizon. The missing of MH370 indicates the lack of regional maritime situational awareness. The enhancement of regional MDA is therefore urgent. In this regard, Japan will continue to help build capacity of regional partners. Japan has thus far limited its maritime surveillance to surrounding sea areas but, it will be also able to conduct maritime surveillance in the South China Sea and elsewhere to develop more accurate maritime situational awareness in Asia.

&nbsp;

South China Sea dangers are compounded by a lack of regional trust. Regional countries need to build trust by building confidence first. As the region often suffers from massive disasters, disaster relief cooperation provides lots of opportunities for goodwill exchanges, capacity building, combined trainings, and saving lives. Disaster relief cooperation is also good in terms of clearing the suspicion China and some ASEAN countries may have about Japan’s new security policy and proactive engagement in the South China Sea disputes.

&nbsp;

China’s rapid and massive land reclamation in the Spratly Islands, coupled with more frequent submarine operations, is intensifying the tension in the South China Sea. As the United States prepares operational assertions within 12 nautical miles from Chinese artificial islands, chances for military confrontation and escalation are becoming higher. Under the new U.S.-Japan Defense Guidelines and security legislation, Japan may be involved in a South China Sea contingency either through logistical support for U.S. military or even collective defense. Under such a circumstance, the SDI is not rhetoric but a strategic objective for Japan.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Year for Optimism in the South China Sea?</title>
		<link>http://amti.csis.org/a-year-for-optimism-in-the-south-china-sea/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In recent weeks, the international politics of the South China Sea has seen a number of encouraging developments. At their meeting on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Beijing in November, Benigno Aquino claimed to have had a “<a href="http://www.interaksyon.com/article/99039/beijing-manila-move-to-calm-south-china-sea-tensions">meeting of minds</a>” with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. Also at the APEC meeting, Xi met his Vietnamese counterpart, where similar sentiments were expressed. Interestingly, in an opinion piece in the Jakarta Post in that same month, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang mooted an idea to make 2015 “<a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/topics_665678/lkqzlcxdyhzldrxlhybdmdjxzsfw/t1212266.shtml">the year of China-ASEAN maritime Cooperation</a>.” An important question for Asian security specialists in 2015 is whether this positive rhetorical momentum can be sustained by the claimants.

It is no coincidence that the turn toward a more positive Chinese stance occurred after the signing of the U.S.-Philippines Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) during President Obama’s visit to Manila in 2014. The Philippines’ Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin has claimed that since EDCA was signed, Chinese naval forces have been deterred from harassing the resupply of a ship deliberately scuttled by the Filipino Navy on Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea.

A number of important questions remain to be answered in 2015. The Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague is currently considering territorial claims in the South China Sea. A decision is expected by late 2015 or early 2016. What decision will it reach? Relatedly, can a Code of Conduct governing inter-state behaviour in the South China Sea be achieved by the relevant parties? Should the situation deteriorate, can the U.S. simultaneously restrain all parties from actions that disrupt the status quo? The year ahead promises to be an interesting one in the South China Sea.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Maritime Asia will be active and more pacific in the coming year. Maritime trade will continue apace with tens of millions of shipping containers and millions of barrels of petroleum products moving on Asian sea lanes. That feeding of the Asian and global economies will be taken for granted, but there are three categories to watch– geopolitical, navies and maritime activity.

Geopolitical: There will not be a breakthrough on the differing Chinese and Japanese positions regarding the East China Sea. In the South China Sea, expansion of facilities on the land features there will continue quietly. More flesh will be added to the bones of China’s “Maritime Silk Road”; and, consistent with the tone of the recent Xiangshan Forum, its companion piece will be China’s increasing call for an “Asia for Asians” regional security architecture to replace U.S. alliance relationships in Asia. China will continue to be pressed on clarifying the “Nine Dash Line.” This will be charged with the PRC- Philippine arbitration of South China Sea claims under UNCLOS.

Navies: Submarines will be the important if somewhat obscure topic of 2015. There will be significant interest in Australia’s plans to replace its Collins Class submarine, especially if it does so in cooperation with Japan, and the Chinese and Indian deterrent submarine programs will recast nuclear deterrence in Asia and change markedly the region’s naval environment. Submarine hunting investments are sure to follow.

Maritime Activity: The PLA Navy will engage in more bilateral naval activity with Asian partners to encourage its alternative security architecture and Silk Road ambition. South China Sea and East China Sea encounters will be more benign keeping with China’s more cooperative “win-win” strategy. Modest U.S. Navy – PLA Navy activity will take place and the newly elected Congress will question it more]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On 28 April 2014, Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin and U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Philip Goldberg signed the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). The EDCA is not a new agreement since it merely updates and enhances the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty. It provides the framework by which the Philippines and the U.S. can develop their individual and collective defense capabilities through the deployment of American troops and equipment on a rotational basis, thus skirting the controversial issue of re-establishing U.S. bases in the country.

With its small and obsolete naval force and an almost non-existent air force, the Philippines relies on the U.S. for technical military assistance through the periodic visits of American forces that joint training, humanitarian missions, and disaster response operations. More significantly, the Philippines banks on the deterrent effect that is generated by the temporary deployment of U.S. forces and their equipment in its territory against threats to its maritime security interests. The EDCA allows American forces to utilize Philippines-owned and controlled facilities but the Philippine base commander has unhampered access to those locations. Likewise, the U.S. military can build or improve the infrastructure inside these installations: nevertheless, the Armed Forces of the Philippines can jointly use them. The system involves bringing American tactical units---personnel and their equipment-- to allied bases in East Asia to plan and exercise contingency missions for crisis or conflict situations.

By <a href="http://www.gov.ph/2014/04/29/document-enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement/">signing the EDCA</a> with the United States, the Aquino Administration has demonstrated the political will to facilitate greater American strategic access to Philippine territory, despite the <a href="http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/393050/news/nation/petitioners-reassert-their-objections-to-edca-pact">opposition of nationalist elements and militant left-wing organizations</a>. As expected, in late May 2014, two former senators and 10 other petitioners asked the Philippine Supreme Court to stop the implementation of the EDCA pending the resolution of its constitutionality, and its adverse implications on Philippine sovereignty and national interests. The petitioners argued that the agreement violates the Philippine Constitution because it sets up de facto U.S. bases on Philippine territory. The petitioners also argued that contrary to the government’s claim that it is an executive agreement, it is actually a treaty that must be ratified by the Philippine Senate. The Aquino Administration, in turn, reaffirmed the constitutionality of the agreement and announced that is prepared to defend its legality in the Philippine Supreme Court. In November 2014, the Supreme Court began to hear the arguments from both sides. The court will probably come out with a decision by the middle of 2015.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Following the election of the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance government in May 2014, we have seen a sharper and more vigorous focus on foreign policy in India. Modi has embraced a more strategic outlook than his predecessors, which signals a break from India’s traditional policy of “non-alignment”. The focus of the Modi government’s foreign policy efforts has been to refresh ties with immediate neighbors, while also strengthening relations with great powers in Asia including Japan, the United States, and Australia.

In 2015, India’s strategic rivalry with China will continue to expand to the maritime domain. The recent passage of Chinese submarines through the Indian Ocean—and docking in Sri Lanka—is rippling through New Delhi’s security community. Such activities will help position President Obama’s visit to India in late January as an opportunity to continue looking for new ways to elevate the US-India strategic partnership.

The ten-year U.S.- India Defense Framework Agreement expires this summer. Both sides are committed to renewing the Agreement, and may find ways to expand elements of maritime cooperation. Maritime cooperation seems particularly opportune given the explicit inclusion of their shared interest in a stable South China Sea as part of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/30/us-india-joint-statement">Joint Statement</a> issued following Prime Minister Modi’s September 2014 visit to Washington.

We may also see the elevation of the important U.S.–Japan-India trilateral dialogue to the ministerial level, as suggested in the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/30/us-india-joint-statement">September Joint Statement</a>. Raising the seniority of this dialogue could open the door to important new areas of cooperation, including the maritime space.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The South China Sea is likely to persist as a source of tension both between China and its Southeast Asian maritime neighbors, and between China and the United States in 2015. China’s land reclamation activities, which are taking place at six of the seven reefs under Chinese control in the Spratly Island chain, will advance next year, revealing Beijing’s plans and intentions. It is likely that ongoing dredging will create airstrips and harbors that will give the Chinese navy and air force greater reach. China will thus increase its ability to patrol and exert greater control over the South China Sea. Moreover, its China will expand its capabilities to monitor a potential air defense identification zone (ADIZ), which may result in a decision to establish an ADIZ similar to the ADIZ that Beijing declared in the East China Sea in November 2013.

A major flashpoint to watch will be Second Thomas Shoal, where a small contingent of Filipino marines stand watch on a rusting <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/10/27/south-china-sea/">World War II vessel that the Philippines beached on the submerged reef in 1999</a>. Chinese patrols keep close watch on the Shoal, permitting the Philippines to re-supply the troops there with food and water, but preventing the delivery of building materials that could be used to reinforce the vessel. Sometime in 2015, that vessel is likely to slide off the Shoal into the water, which could precipitate a crisis as the Philippines launches a rescue mission to pull its marines out of the water and possibly tries to run another ship aground on the Shoal, and Chinese law-enforcement ships move in to attempt to seize control of the reef.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Intense Maneuvers at the Hague</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2013, the Philippines instituted arbitration proceedings in the Hague against China over disputed South China Sea maritime claims – and in doing so it challenged legally of China’s nine-dash line claims over much of that area. Both states are parties to the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which allows for binding dispute resolution through the Permanent Court of Arbitration. China has boycotted the proceedings, arguing that in ratifying UNCLOS it had opted out of mandatory dispute settlement of matters relating to sea boundaries.

Some expect the Permanent Court of Arbitration to reach a decision on jurisdiction – a preliminary ruling on whether it has authority to reach the ultimate merits – in 2015. More likely, though, it will schedule a hearing on the issue next year, which China will probably boycott, and even that preliminary decision on jurisdiction will not occur until 2016 because the jurisdictional arguments are so intertwined with complex issues that go to the ultimate merits. The legal maneuvering in 2015 will be intense, though, because the stakes are high.

For the parties themselves, even an ultimate decision on the merits of these issues may not settle the disputes, because China may ignore an arbitral ruling that it regards as illegitimate. But in the meantime, a decision on jurisdiction will shift diplomatic leverage one direction or the other.

For the United States, which is a treaty ally of the Philippines, a decision in the Hague that accepts jurisdiction could exacerbate tension between two policy tenets: that the United States does not take a position on competing sovereignty claims in the South China Sea and that it promotes settlement of disputes according to international law. Perhaps the United States can push harder for all parties, including China, to abide by arbitral decisions, but doing so is awkward because the United States has not itself ratified UNCLOS and thereby subjected itself to binding dispute resolution.

For the UNCLOS system – as a body of rules and binding dispute settlement mechanisms – prominence and credibility are at stake. A decision that the arbitral panel has jurisdiction would push UNCLOS and its international adjudicators further to the fore of disputes in this regional hotspot. In doing so, however, the arbitral panel would risk being ignored, derided and marginalized by the biggest player in the region.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Despite the growing interest in maritime security in the Indo-Pacific region among experts, it remains an open question how focused the Obama administration will be on the challenges in that region in 2015. It is doubtful that the security of the offshore Pacific island chain ranks in the top five issues for National Security Advisor Susan Rice or Secretary of State John Kerry. The Ebola Crisis crowded out more traditional security concerns for a time –probably for good reasons. Meanwhile, the evidence is growing that President Vladmir Putin’s pressure on the Ukraine, Eastern Europe and the Baltic states may be increasing as a consequence of Russia’s desperate economic situation. The United States is being pulled further into the Iraq again with the ISIL threat; and the deadline for a nuclear agreement with Iran has passed without consequences or any new prospect for a diplomatic resolution. The Defense Department meanwhile will face increasing trade-offs between sustaining the numbers of surface combatants committed to the Pacific and investing in new technologies to counter the anti-access/area-denial capabilities being developed and deployed by China –not to mention a renewed operational upswing in Southwest Asia. Defense Secretary-nominee Ash Carter is an expert on these technologies, but will face some difficult trade-offs if defense budgets continue facing the downward pressure from sequestration.

On the other hand, U.S. defense engagement and capacity building with maritime states in the Pacific are on track to deepen in 2015. Fresh from his electoral victory, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will be well positioned to pass legislation relating to the right of collective self-defense, and specifically allowing more joint operations with U.S. forces. The U.S.-Philippines Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) and the partial lifting of the arms embargo on Vietnam will help both those countries strengthen their maritime domain awareness, backed by offers of patrol craft and other support from Japan. At the same time, President Obama’s agreement with President Xi Jinping in November to provide prior notification of major military exercises or defense policy reports demonstrates that U.S. support for maritime states has not come at the expense of inching towards reassurance and confidence building with Beijing. These developments provide the basis for modest optimism about stability in maritime Asia in 2015, as long as the administration recognizes that the appearance of American distraction might cause others to view 2015 as a period of opportunity.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A 2015 Resolution for Risk Reduction</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In tracking Asia’s maritime tensions in 2015, what I will be looking for above all is evidence that China is actually following through on its newfound commitments to risk-reduction and crisis-management.

For much of the time since Chinese maritime assertiveness increased, from 2009 onwards, the guiding attitude seemed to be that Chinese forces were willing to countenance risk as a tactic. In my discussions with Chinese security thinkers, I frequently encountered the view that China was not willing to embrace practical confidence-building measures (CBMs) – like hotlines and an ‘incidents at sea’ agreement – until some kind of strategic trust had been established. In other words, the Chinese view seemed, paradoxically, to be that there was no point pursuing risk-reduction measures until fundamental strategic differences had been resolved – by which time, CBMs would no longer be needed.

It has been mildly heartening in recent months to see some movement in this position. The CBMs agreement between President Xi and President Obama, the decision to move at last towards operationalizing a China-Japan hotline, and the constructive rhetoric at the Xiangshan Forum and <a href="http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2014/12/01/Xi-Jinping-speech-More-diplomacy-less-raw-power.aspx">President Xi’s recent speech</a> – all of these are signals that the PLA is now ready to talk the talk on maritime crisis-management.

The big question for 2015 is, will they walk the walk? After all, Chinese strategic goals presumably have not changed; it is not at all clear that the behavior of the various <a href="http://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/chinas-unpredictable-maritime-security-actors">Chinese maritime security actors</a> has become more stable or predictable; and the annual Asian summitry season, with its imperative for suspending security tensions in favor of political consensus-building , is now over. The test of China’s goodwill is <a href="http://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/managing-maritime-disputes-and-tensions-indo-pacific-asia?noredirect=1">yet to come</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On July 3, 2014, the President of China, Xi Jinping, made a historic visit to Seoul. It holds significance because this was the first time a Chinese President has visited Seoul before traveling to Pyongyang. Moreover, the <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1172038.shtml">Joint Statement released as an outcome of the summit</a> between President Xi and President Park Geun-hye, includes some significant agreements for furthering cooperation on maritime security. For instance, according to Paragraph 5 of the Joint Statement, both countries will resume negotiations in 2015 on maritime delimitation. On August 3, 2000, China and the ROK concluded a bilateral fisheries agreement, pending final agreement on maritime delimitation. If an agreement on a boundary between the two countries’ EEZs and the Continental Shelves is therefore concluded, this will resolve two maritime disputes existing between them. These are: 1) the Ieodo issue (a submerged maritime feature that both the ROK and China claim), and 2) the conservation of fishery resources depleted through illegal fishing activities mainly conducted by Chinese vessels around the Northern Limit Line (NLL).

To resolve these disputes through negotiations, there are three significant preconditions that must be agreed upon. They include: 1) a single (or multipurpose) maritime boundary which encompasses the EEZs as well as the Continental Shelves; 2) determination of relevant coastlines and sea areas including waters around Ieodo and up to the limits of the NLL; and 3) a finding that the Continental Shelf between them is a shared continental shelf whose concept has been well established by the precedents of various international tribunals. If the agreement on the single maritime boundary is concluded, the year 2015 will be a milestone for future cooperation on maritime security between China and the ROK.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>ASEAN’s Domestic Politics: Rule of Law on the Sea</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When the Philippines announced its intent in January 2013 to file a case against China at a tribunal in the Permanent Court of Arbitration, many ASEAN countries remained silent or even worried out loud that Manila was “rolling the dice” and would be the subject of Beijing’s wrath. The mood in Southeast Asia has changed. In 2015 there is likely to be a further coalescing of support among ASEAN countries for the Philippines’ case.

What has changed is that Southeast Asian governments’ trust in Beijing and its South China Sea policies has eroded. This is because of Chinese actions and a growing concern about China’s intentions from a Southeast Asian middle class that is rapidly expanding and becoming more politically active.

When the Philippines announced its case, there was still strong hope among ASEAN policymakers that China would revert to the regional “charm offensive” it initiated during the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990’s. That initiative ended in 2009, when China submitted its nine-dash line claim to a substantial part of the South China Sea to a UN body. Still, ASEAN government’s hoped China would back off its robust sovereignty claims and focus on economic partnership in the region.

Those hopes evaporated as China continued to assert itself by seizing Scarborough Shoal, unilaterally declaring an Air Defense Identification Zone over the East China Sea, laying claim to a submerged feature in Malaysian waters, and placing a China National Offshore Oil Corporation rig on Vietnam’s continental shelf. <a href="http://csis.org/files/publication/140605_Green_PowerandOrder_WEB.pdf">CSIS polling of Southeast Asian elites</a> in early 2014 shows a distinct trend of growing distrust of China and concern that China represents a future strategic and security threat.

ASEAN governments, impressed by the Philippines’ strong commitment to see its case through, have started to share publicly what they have been saying privately over the last couple years, namely that they too are concerned by Beijing’s apparent unwillingness to abide by international law in regard to the South China Sea disputes. These concerns have a growing political base that is seeking more input into policy in general, including foreign and national security policy around Southeast Asia. Even Singapore, once able to formulate an intensely practical foreign policy, finds itself more influenced by domestic political opinion.

ASEAN support for the Philippines’ case has started to become more apparent and this is a trend we can expect to increase in 2015. Vietnam has <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/12/vietnam-launches-legal-challenge-against-chinas-south-china-sea-claims/">filed a statement of interest</a> with the court, largely in support of the Philippines’ position, and political leaders in Indonesia and Malaysia have begun to express concern about Chinese actions and intent in the South China Sea. More ASEAN voices will be heard as the award in the Philippine case, now expected in the latter half of 2015, approaches.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Oil Rig 981 Friction in the South China Sea</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The friction between China and Vietnam over the oil rig Haiyang Shiyou-981 (in Vietnamese: Hải Dương-981) was a major point of South China Sea tension in 2014. The stakes were not so big that that the parties resorted to military action, but this episode was an important sign that Hanoi does not intend to swallow the bitter fruit of China’s laying its oil rig into Vietnamese claimed EEZ. Beijing, of course, considers that its oil drilling took place legally in the adjacent waters of Woody Island, a one of the Paracel Islands, over which China maintains de facto control despite claims by other states. Both sides seem quite intractable in insisting on the legitimacy of their claims.

The worse part of oil rig 981 friction is that Chinese and Vietnamese risked violence to advanced their competing claims. Beijing mobilized dozens of its official boats and even warships to escort the oil rig. Hanoi dispatched hundreds of its coast guard ships and fishing boats to force their way into the area near the oil rig. Beijing forcefully uses its escorting ships to intercept Vietnamese vessels. Chinese sources reveal that more than 300 instances of ramming and bumping happened at sea. There is no doubt that the friction could have rapidly escalated into a military clash if the Vietnamese had responded by sending naval ships to the area. Since the public standoff between China and the Philippines over the Scarborough Shoal in April 2012, it was one more instance of paramilitary confrontation in the South China Sea.

Looking to 2015, it is likely that China will move an oil rig back to disputed water area. Certainly Vietnam will harass China’s oil rig operations as expected. That sort of tit-for-tat contestation will not diminish unless Beijing and Hanoi can make a political deal to mutually accommodate oil drilling in disputed waters in the South China Sea. Unfortunately, such an agreement seems unlikely at present.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In November, Tokyo and Beijing agreed to disagree on their views on territory and history to resume talks on crisis communication mechanisms in the East China Sea. Tokyo and Beijing reached a common understanding of its structure and methods that a hotline should employ. There is an urgent need for such a mechanism due to China’s more frequent and regular naval and air activities around Japan. A priority for Japan’s maritime security is to implement this crisis management mechanism.

As the year 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, history may hinder crisis management talks again. Beijing has already prepared commemoration of the victory in the “anti-fascist war.” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe plans to make his own statement on history next year, and it needs to be realistic and forward-looking to prevent history from casting a dark shadow over the East China Sea.

In 2015, Tokyo and Washington will revise the <a href="http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/n-america/us/security/guideline2.html">1997 Bilateral Defense Cooperation Guidelines</a>. Under new the new guidelines, Japanese and American forces will work as one regionally and globally in peacetime, wartime, and in grey-zones, or situations short of armed conflict. Such enhanced combined defense posture in the East China Sea, however, will invite strong Chinese protest. The revision is necessary to balance China’s maritime expansion in the Western Pacific. But to avoid unnecessary friction, Tokyo should notify Beijing of the progress on the revision in advance to build confidence and trust.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Visibility-Vulnerability Dilemma and Defense</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In this last quarter of the Obama administration, U.S. leaders have a critical opportunity to make progress on a host of policies vital to strengthening the U.S. position in Asia. While the Trans-Pacific Partnership will rightfully dominate the domestic debate in early 2015, an equally important debate is occurring in the halls of the Pentagon and Capitol Hill – one between <em><strong>visibility and vulnerability</strong></em>.

This tradeoff is critical because the value of visibility and the danger of vulnerability differ in peacetime and wartime. In peacetime, U.S. forces are most useful when they are most visible. Visible forces reassure allies and partners while deterring potential adversaries. Yet, visibility comes at a cost – increased vulnerability. Publicly sailing a carrier strike group into a disputed area can be a strong signal of resolve, but in wartime such actions open these forces to attack. Therefore, while U.S. leaders seek to maximize visibility in peacetime, they often attempt to minimize vulnerability is wartime.

The capabilities that maximize visibility and those that minimize vulnerability are quite different; sequestration is forcing U.S. leaders to choose between them. How should leaders in Washington decide in which capabilities to invest? One way is to examine the range of possible conflict scenarios and assess the advantages and disadvantages of visibility and vulnerability in each. Three types of potential Asian conflict scenarios—arrayed on a spectrum from peacetime to wartime—are particularly instructive: low-level coercion, short war, and protracted war.

<em><strong>Low-level coercion</strong></em>, such as China’s ongoing efforts in the East and South China Seas, sit between peacetime and wartime. Because low-level coercion does not fit cleanly into the black and white categories of war and peace, some experts refer to these conflicts as “grey zones.” In the grey zones, visibility is valued because U.S. allies want Washington to demonstrate its resolve both to their publics and their adversaries.

<em><strong>Short wars</strong></em> require a different set of capabilities. In short wars, striking first and striking hard is vital, so forces must be resident in the region. In such conflicts, visibility can be a danger, opening forces to attack. Yet, visible strength can also deescalate conflict. Furthermore, although vulnerability is a risk in these situations, some degree of vulnerability is required as surging forces into a conflict zone puts U.S. forces at risk. Thus, in short wars a balance between visibility and vulnerability is necessary.

<em><strong>Protracted wars</strong></em>, on the other hand, typically advantage the least vulnerable forces. As the World Wars demonstrated, protracted wars often turn into economic contests. During such conflicts, units that can be seen can typically be struck, making visibility dangerous. Such conflicts therefore necessitate platforms that are hard for opponents to find.

How do these different types of conflicts and capabilities shape the 2015 debate? Briefly examining trends in military investments in the two most likely contestants in instructive, particularly because the United States and China have been headed in opposite directions.

<em><strong>The United States</strong></em> has long relied on highly visible forces to demonstrate resolve. Visible forces have reassured allies and deterred adversaries by committing the United States to involvement if a conflict were to occur. Increasingly, however, anti-access/area denial capabilities (A2/AD) have exacerbated the vulnerability of visible forces, such as forward deployed bases and platforms. Therefore, the Pentagon has increasingly invested in minimizing vulnerability, such as submarines and stealth.

<em><strong>China,</strong></em> on the other hand, has long sought less vulnerable forces. Chinese A2/AD systems, such as its missiles forces and submarines, limit China’s vulnerability to a U.S. strike. Recently, however, Beijing has sought to acquire more visible power projection forces such as aircraft carriers. These visible platforms are intended to coerce Chinese neighbors, even if they risk increased vulnerability.

These opposing trends in U.S. and Chinese military investment have important implications for potential contingencies in East Asia. The decrease in the vulnerability of U.S. forces is helping Washington to prepare for a protracted conflict. Beijing, on the other hand, is building more visible forces ideal for grey zone conflicts. As a result of these investment trends and policy choices in both countries, China has been successfully pressuring its neighbors on maritime disputes. U.S. leaders, therefore, are starting to ask how the United States can better address grey zone coercion.

What are the implications of this visibility-vulnerability dilemma for the Pentagon? For the Navy the question is whether to retain more visible aircraft carriers or less vulnerable submarines. For the Air Force the issue is purchasing more visible fighter aircraft or less vulnerable long-range strike bombers. For the Army and Marine Corps the tension is between highly visible forward deployed forces or less vulnerable units surged from afar. Each service is being forced to risk decreased visibility in peacetime or increased vulnerability in wartime.

The leadership at the Pentagon is well equipped to deal with this dilemma, but these leaders cannot avoid the choice between a more visible force and a more vulnerable one. Worse still, sequestration has tied the Pentagon’s hands and forced the United States to accept increased risk across the entire conflict spectrum. Moreover, requirements for deterring a resurgent Russia and combating Middle Eastern insurgents will compel the United States to invest with other regions in mind.

As the U.S. debate on Asia heats up in early 2015, regional leaders will be watching closely. Allies such as Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the Philippines are looking for a more visible U.S. presence. Meanwhile, many U.S. defense experts focused on the military threat from China are pushing for a less vulnerable force. This presents a challenge for leaders in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill. The next six months are a critical window during which bipartisan cooperation on defense capabilities is possible, but a coherent U.S. strategy for Asia must include a strategy to harvest the benefits of visibility while mitigating the dangers of vulnerability across the full conflict spectrum.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Where China is concerned, successful implementation of the rebalance hinges upon a recognition in both capitals that neither country can hope to organize the future order in East Asia without the other. Chinese and U.S. leaderships say they subscribe to this axiom, but their respective behavior suggests that both sides seem reluctant to truly eschew zero-sum approaches. The notion of dividing Asia into discrete spheres of influence is implicit in many Chinese renderings of President Xi’s proposal for a “new style of major country relations.” To combat this tendency, the U.S. administration must put more energy behind the traditional strengths of the relationship while not shying away from elements that are harder to manage as a consequence of China’s growing power and influence.

The deep economic interdependence between the United States and China has long served as an important shock absorber to the relationship’s more competitive elements but we cannot take for granted that economic ties will continue playing this stabilizing role. Companies in both countries increasingly decry the lack of a level playing field in the other, creating the risk that investment climate recriminations could become explosive. The administration and the Hill should work together to reassure fearful Chinese investors by not threatening legislation that would put new restrictions on Chinese investment, and, more helpfully still, should send a clear indication that the door will remain open to interested firms where no genuine national security concerns arise.

The administration also must confront an emerging mindset among Chinese officialdom that foreign countries and businesses need the China market much more than China needs their investment. This notion helps to rationalize seemingly counterproductive Chinese behavior such as cyberespionage for commercial benefit and the use of legal and regulatory measures to pressure foreign firms. The administration can better respond by approaching Chinese behavior as a holistic and coordinated industrial policy rather than a series of discrete actions.

President Xi’s growing emphasis on shifting the locus of policymaking to Communist Party organs rather than those of the state also deserves greater attention. Xi has established several new Party “leading groups”, and these bodies oversee policy on areas of obvious U.S. concern—security, economic, and cyber issues just to name a few. The United States has no dialogue with these new entities or the senior Chinese officials running them. The lack of such access increases the likelihood of misperception regarding Chinese motives and intentions, suggesting President Obama should encourage President Xi to craft a mechanism for engaging these bodies.

Turning to the relationship’s more intractable elements, furthering the implementation of conflict-avoidance mechanisms should remain a priority in the military-to-military arena. The U.S.-China agreement signed last November on rules of behavior for safe military encounters at sea and in the air, beginning with establishment of guidelines for encounters between naval surface ships, has set a good foundation. In 2015, the United States and China should realize their commitment to complete an annex on air-to-air encounters. Efforts should also be made to reach agreement with China and other regional nations to extend the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES) to apply to coast guards, which would further reduce uncertainties and the risk of accidents. To ensure that the U.S.-China mil-mil agenda serves a consistent set of U.S. national security objectives, an oversight mechanism should be established to monitor the diverse bilateral engagements going forward.

In the East and South China Seas, the administration should develop an interagency plan to provide incentives to China to engage in cooperative, tension-reducing behaviors, and to impose costs for destabilizing, coercive actions. For example, China’s participation in the U.S.-led multilateral Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) naval exercises in 2016—preparations for which will get underway in 2015—could be expanded if China curtails provocative actions. The PLA could also be invited to conduct more trilateral military exercises with the United States and its regional allies like the survival skills drill held recently in Australia. Good behavior could be rewarded by an administration decision to have the U.S. secretary of defense attend China’s Xiangshan Forum in 2015. Bad behavior should result in denial of such rewards, increased U.S. military operations and activities in the waters around China, and the fostering of a growing web of intra-Asian security cooperation that excludes China.

U.S. interests with China and the broader region can be more effectively advanced by working more closely not only with allies and partners in Asia, but also with those in Europe. The United States should bolster coordination and cooperation with European nations to sustain a rules-based international order founded on open markets, respect for the rule of law, peaceful resolution of disputes, and free access to the global commons. The European Union could join the efforts of the United States and Japan to enhance maritime domain awareness of the Southeast Asian littoral nations. As an incentive for China to strengthen, rather than challenge, the existing world order, the United States and EU could coordinate with other members of the International Space Station (ISS) to offer the possibility of China joining some activities aboard the ISS with the prospect of eventual full membership. Greater EU involvement in Asia could pave the way for EU participation in the East Asia Summit, which is an EU objective.

		<title>Explaining and Resourcing the Rebalance</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There is robust support for the pivot to Asia in the United States and the region, but there are questions about the goal of the strategy and the resources available. U.S. agencies have made parallel efforts to expand engagement in Asia, but there is no unifying strategic plan that aligns these efforts to national goals. The administration argues that speeches by the president and principals explain the strategy, but a side-by-side comparison of those speeches reveals persistent inconsistency about the strategy behind the pivot. Almost every speech begins by listing the top three or four objectives of the pivot or rebalance, and in almost every speech they are different.<sup>1</sup> One of the greatest areas of inconsistency has been the shifting definition of how the United States will manage China’s rising power and influence—from a declaration of respect for China’s “core interests” in 2009, to the listing of China as a major security threat alongside Iran in the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance, to confusion about whether the administration accepts President Xi Jinping’s “New Model of Great Power Relations” and what it means for allies that are not considered “great powers” by Beijing.

The inconsistent articulation of the strategy has caused some confusion among China and regional allies and has undermined congressional support for the funding necessary to modernize and realign U.S. forces in the Pacific consistent with the administration’s plans. In an effort to encourage clearer articulation of the ends, ways, and means behind the rebalance, the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr4435pcs/pdf/BILLS-113hr4435pcs.pdf">2015 National Defense Authorization Act</a> includes a provision requiring that the Department of Defense submit an Asia strategy report to Congress. Such a report would help to build bridges to Congress and reduce uncertainty about U.S. intentions in the region. The administration may want to consider a National Security Council (NSC)-led process to capture the comprehensive trade, diplomatic, and defense elements of the rebalance.

For its part, the Congress should be prepared to fund the fairly modest costs of modernizing U.S. facilities in Guam and elsewhere in the Pacific Command’s area of responsibility. This would be an early indication to U.S. allies that the Congress and administration are prepared to work together to sustain momentum in our engagement of the region.

The larger resource problem must also be tackled, however. When the rebalance strategy was in its infancy, the Budget Control Act cut $487 billion from the 10-year defense budget plan and then sequestration cut another $470 billion over the next nine years. These reductions followed earlier defense spending cuts initiated by the Pentagon, which eliminated another $300 billion. Moreover, sequestration limits the Pentagon’s ability to reallocate funds across accounts, preventing the Pentagon from prioritizing and optimizing across the defense enterprise.

Without additional resources, U.S. leaders face a choice between sustaining existing capacity and developing new capabilities. Military challengers in Asia are simultaneously expanding capacity and advancing capability, made possible by rapidly growing defense budgets. In Washington, however, there is pressure to cut existing U.S. capacity or future capabilities. The number of forward-deployed carrier strike groups is jeopardy as leaders look to fund investments in technological innovation. Under current defense budgets, investing in future capabilities risks severe cuts to current capacity, and vice versa. The size and readiness of the current force is vital, but so too are future capabilities needed to maintain the U.S. ability to project power in Asia.
For the United States to demonstrate its long-term reliability to allies and partners while displaying resolve to potential adversaries it must show that it can invest simultaneously in today’s force and tomorrow’s force. If the United States funds the current force at the expense of future capabilities, it risks the long-term viability of U.S. power projection. But if investments in the future force come at the expense of the current force, they risk the appearance of U.S. weakness and could invite near-term challenges.

To devote the necessary funding to accomplish U.S. strategy in Asia, Congress should pass a nonbinding budget resolution in April 2015 that sets spending above the sequestration caps and lays the groundwork for increased spending in the reconciliation process. By September, congressional leaders should prepare a deal on sequestration that President Obama can sign. With budget deficits abating and revenues on the rise, there should be more flexibility to work on revenue enhancements to revive defense spending without linking it to domestic spending. Budgets should be dictated by strategy, not the other way around. These steps would free the leadership of the administration and the Congress to focus on getting the strategy right, rather than meeting budget targets.

		<title>Advancing the Rebalance in Southeast Asia</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The year 2015 provides the Obama administration with new opportunities in Southeast Asia to reinforce and bolster the rebalance to Asia.

<em>Myanmar</em>

In Myanmar, the United States should expand its support and training efforts to build political parties, strengthen the parliament, and prepare for monitoring activities ahead of the country’s 2015 elections to ensure they are inclusive, transparent, and credible. If the constitution is not amended prior to the elections to reduce the military’s veto power over amendments, Washington will want to push for this to be done soon after the new parliament and government take office in early 2016. This will be necessary to convince people in Myanmar that the country has turned the corner from military rule to democracy. In addition, the United States will want to continue supporting efforts by the government and armed ethnic groups to reach a ceasefire.

<em>Indonesia</em>

The president will want to follow up on his invitation to new Indonesian president Joko “Jokowi” Widodo to visit the United States. Obama should push to further flesh out the <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/10/215196.htm">comprehensive partnership</a> launched between the two countries in 2010. Cooperation on infrastructure development may be one idea on which the two countries can cooperate. Jokowi appears committed to rapid infrastructure development to reduce transportation bottlenecks, including developing Indonesia into a maritime power. This new focus may provide opportunities for participation by the U.S. private sector.

<em>Vietnam</em>

President Obama should plan to visit Vietnam in 2015 to push the comprehensive partnership, launched between the two countries in mid-2013, to new depths. The administration, which in September 2014 <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/us-eases-ban-on-lethal-military-hardware-sales-to-vietnam/2471086.html">partially lifted the ban</a> on the sale of weapons to Vietnam, should continue to work with Vietnam to amend in the National Assembly ahead of the president’s trip. November 2015, when Obama attends the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in the Philippines and the East Asia Summit in Malaysia, would be a good time for the president to visit Hanoi.

<em>Thailand</em>

The United States will want to continue to monitor developments in Thailand in the wake of the May 2014 coup and consider opportunities for the United States to engage its oldest partner in Asia. The generals had promised elections by the end of 2015 but it now appears that they have decided to delay voting until 2016 or even until the critical transition in the country’s monarchy takes place. Even in advance of elections, Washington will want to explore opportunities for contacts with private Thais to support the development of a middle ground where issues such as democracy, rule of law, and respect for human rights can be discussed.

<em>South China Sea</em>

No matter what way the arbitration tribunal established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea rules in the Philippines’ case against China, probably before the end of 2015, it will be a watershed for the South China Sea disputes. How the United States responds, and in particular how successful it is in bolstering the case for peaceful resolution and respect for international law, will go a long way toward convincing Southeast Asia of the long-term sustainability and benefits of the U.S. rebalance.

The Obama administration has taken commendable steps over the last year to strengthen its position regarding the illegality of Chinese claims in the South China Sea—most recently by publishing a study on the nine-dash line via the State Department’s Limits in the Sea series. As a judgment in the arbitration case approaches, it will be crucial that Washington rally international support for the tribunal, and insist that China respect any award issued. U.S. support, and pressure, will also be necessary to strengthen spines in other Southeast Asian nations and ensure that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) voices full-throated support for Manila’s right to arbitration and the need to respect the ruling.

In the meantime, Washington should also step up efforts to bolster maritime domain awareness, patrol, and deterrence capabilities in Southeast Asia. This will include pushing the Philippines to implement the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement signed in early 2014, boosting funding, training, and equipment transfers to partners including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. In Vietnam’s case, it is unlikely that the administration will move to provide ships, radars, or armaments in 2015, but it should be actively consulting with Hanoi on Vietnamese needs and preparing to move once politically feasible.

The State Department should work to assist Southeast Asian claimants with legal clarification of their own claims in order to maintain the moral and legal high ground vis-à-vis China. The United States should also urge Southeast Asians to pursue bilateral agreements on overlapping claims where possible, agree among themselves what areas around the Paracel and Spratly Islands they consider legally disputed, and engage in a comprehensive survey of those features to counter the legal obfuscation caused by Chinese reclamation work on submerged features and low-lying features.

		<title>Heavy Lifting in Washington on Asian Maritime Security</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Asian maritime security issues will continue to be topical in Washington in 2015 and there will be a lot of D.C. chatter about events in the Indo-Pacific region. To make a difference and to produce favorable outcomes for the United States, however, some heavy lifting must take place in Washington.

The most important maritime activity in Asia is trade - the movement of resources and products on the sea that feed Asian economies, and, by extension, the global economy. There is no better way to enhance the U.S. position in that regard and to balance our re-balancing strategy to Asia (away from a too- heavily-weighted security focus) than to conclude the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement. It makes sense economically and it will be a clear signal, in the region and beyond, that we are acting strategically.

Security will remain a much-watched aspect of re-balancing, but the re-apportionment of forces to the Pacific cannot remain the only compelling talking point. The shifting of forces from east to west is essentially complete and new capabilities that are perfect for the region are ready for increased production and deployment. The Navy’s TRITON high altitude, long endurance unmanned aircraft are one such example. The consequential work of a meaningful rebalance is returning to fiscal discipline and enacting real reform that can set the course for an unambiguous, enduring and relevant U.S. security posture in the region. The following policy moves are fundamental to that end:
<ul>
	<li>Avoid sequestration. This will be addressed in a few short months in the upcoming Budget Resolution. How much we spend on defense matters greatly, but more important is avoiding the blunt, inflexible cuts to programs that will define our military power and presence in the region.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Return to regular order. For the past few years we have departed from the proven process of addressing and overseeing budget priorities by considering the ends, ways and means of strategy and budgets. The leadership of the new Congress set this as an objective which will do much to inject coherence and predictability into defense and non-defense priorities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li> Reform procurement. The Senate and the House Armed Services Committees must deliver on their stated desire to take this on. Too much time and money is spent on getting relevant capabilities into the hands of America’s young men and women whom we send into harm’s way. For a nation that leads global innovation, this sclerotic procurement process must change dramatically if we are to take full advantage of our technological superiority. A companion piece to procurement reform must be a new approach to enabling easier transfer of technology to our allies and like-minded partners in Asia. Combined, both will enable more rapid deployment of winning capability and improved interoperability in the region. The first step should be to formally integrate the heads of each service into the acquisition process and hold them accountable for timely outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Reform military compensation. The top line of the defense budget gets attention but the budget is also being eroded rapidly from within because of the soaring cost of total compensation (pay, medical, retirement, etc.). Now is the time to devise a compensation scheme for this century that attracts the best and brightest in what is sure to be a very competitive employment market in the coming decades.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Make the Arctic a priority. The opening of the Arctic Ocean is significant because of new resource extraction and maritime activity there, both of consequence to Asian nations. As an Arctic nation, and soon to be chair of the Arctic Council, we must raise awareness of the opportunities and challenges in the High North, approach the Arctic as a national strategic priority and make appropriate investments to ensure a safe, secure and prosperous Arctic.</li>
</ul>
The above may seem detached from headlines of Asian maritime issues, but it is exactly what is needed to get our house in order, provide stability and coherence to the investments we must make now to remain an enduring and stabilizing force in the Indo- Pacific region.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>China’s Maritime Actors: Coordinated and Directed from the Top</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[China’s various maritime actors are increasingly being coordinated and directed by senior policymakers as part of a larger strategy aimed at protecting China’s sovereignty and maritime rights. The first signs of strengthened coordination and supervision were evident as early as mid-2012, when Chinese maritime vessels and Chinese fishing boats—with People Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) ships over the horizon—seized control over Scarborough Shoal, an unoccupied reef, after a ten-week standoff with the Philippines. Chinese experts dubbed the layering of fishing boats, law-enforcement ships, and naval vessels around disputed territory a “cabbage strategy.” China subsequently applied the tactic to the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea. Although Beijing has not wrested control of the islands from Japan, it has nevertheless posed a challenge to Tokyo’s administrative control over them.

In mid-2013, China implemented the “cabbage strategy” again when it deployed the deep sea oil rig, Haiyang Shiyou 981, in waters off the coast of the Paracel Islands and in Vietnam’s 200 nm Exclusive Economic Zone. As <a href="http://www.eastwestcenter.org/publications/us-should-help-vietnam-counter-china%E2%80%99s-coercion">Patrick Cronin</a> wrote at the time, “China has created a <em>cordon sanitaire</em> around the rig by deploying military, coast guard, and fishing vessels in three concentric patrol circles.” A few months earlier, Chinese Coast Guard ships tried to prevent the Philippines from delivering food, water, and fresh troops to their military outpost on Second Thomas Shoal, a submerged reef in the Spratly Island chain. Chinese aircraft flew overhead and PLAN ships observed from a distance. These examples are a consequence of senior leadership direction over the operational activities of China’s maritime actors, and demonstrate their skillful synchronization.

Direct orders are reportedly being given to warships and surveillance vessels by the “Central Maritime Rights Leading Small Group” (<em>zhongyang haiyang quanyi gongzuo lingdao xiaozu</em>), which Xi Jinping has headed since its creation in September 2012. The group also includes senior representatives from the State Oceanic Administration and the PLA General Staff Department, as well as the most senior official in charge of foreign policy, State Councilor Yang Jiechi. According to <em><a href="http://www.asahi.com/articles/DA3S11530796.html">Asahi</a></em>, the members “give instructions to warships and surveillance vessels in the disputed waters over radio or television phone.” Another key decision making body is the “Office to Respond to the Diaoyu Crisis” (<em>diaoyudao yingbian xiaozu</em>), which Xi also heads.

To be sure, China’s numerous maritime actors at times act independently of the central government and pursue their parochial interests. Such autonomous activism can make China’s behavior in the near seas of East Asia unpredictable and result in heightened tensions or even conflict, as argued by <a href="http://www.lowyinstitute.org/files/chinas-unpredictable-maritime-security-actors_3.pdf">Linda Jakobson</a>. But in the instances where China’s maritime behavior has been most aggressive and destabilizing, the actions of its various maritime players have been coordinated and purposeful. When necessary, Beijing can effectively direct the military and the various maritime law enforcement agencies in support of its overall strategic objective. That objective is to advance Beijing’s control over its near seas to the extent possible based on China’s capacity. Greater control is deemed necessary to defend Chinese sovereignty and maritime rights.

The United States must correctly assess the causes of China’s assertive maritime conduct if it is to formulate an effective response. It can use deterrence and dissuasion strategies to alter the calculus of Chinese decision makers if provocative actions are directed and coordinated from above. The Obama administration has taken a number of steps, including enhancing maritime domain awareness of Japan and the Southeast Asian littoral nations, strengthening regional security architecture, prodding China to implement confidence-building measures with Japan and adopt a Code of Conduct with ASEAN, and prioritizing China’s regional maritime behavior in bilateral US-China discussions. These efforts will need to be sustained and bolstered in 2015.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Legal Posturing and Power Relations in the South China Sea</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the weakest military and economic powers in the region – the Philippines – took the strongest – China – to international court in 2013. The Philippines challenges China’s assertion of vast maritime claims over the South China Sea, pursuant to detailed rules and binding dispute resolution processes of the <a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/04_unclos.jpg">UN Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)</a>, to which they are both party. China has scoffed.

It is tempting but mistaken to view this as a stark test of law versus raw might. In defending the decision to seek binding arbitration against China, the Philippine ambassador to the United States recently <a href="http://news.pia.gov.ph/article/view/1781420902874/-international-law-is-the-great-equalizer-says-ph-ambassador-to-us">described</a> “international law [as] the great equalizer.” That is a vast exaggeration. It is also a mistake to view legal rules and processes as blunt tools that lock parties to rigid stances. Sometimes that is true, but this case has pushed the relevant parties to clarify their positions while offering them a range of possible maneuvers. Recent moves and countermoves by the key players, large and small, shows that they all see legal arguments and processes as elements of power that must be integrated pragmatically – and sometimes incrementally – with their respective overall strategy towards maritime and territorial disputes.

In 2013, the Philippines took a bold step of instituting arbitration proceedings in the Hague against China over disputed South China Sea maritime claims. In doing so, the Philippines challenged <a href="http://amti.csis.org/atlas/#9dash">China’s nine-dash line</a>, which China has never clarified, leading many to interpret it as Beijing’s claim to much of the South China Sea. UNCLOS allows parties to request binding dispute resolution through the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The maximal goal of this proceeding would be to settle some of the biggest South China Sea maritime quarrels, though the arbitral panel cannot settle sovereignty over disputed islands and the many possible outcomes include a decision by that institution that it lacks jurisdiction or its resolution of only parts of the many conflicting legal claims.

China has boycotted the proceedings, arguing that the tribunal lacks jurisdiction because, among other reasons, China had expressly opted out of mandatory dispute settlement of matters related to sea boundaries when it ratified UNCLOS. In other words, China refuses to submit to formal and binding legal proceedings on this matter. China has so far even refused to file a brief with the arbitral panel, and it may choose not to appear before it for hearings. This is not so surprising, for a player that currently benefits from ambiguity about the full extent of its South China Sea claims has much to lose in the ruling. China does not want to lend the Tribunal legitimacy, and holds other forms of power – economic and military – it can bring to bear on the dispute. There is probably a dissenting view within the Chinese government, though, that believes it stands a better chance of having the case dismissed by pressing its jurisdictional arguments formally and directly in the Hague.

While holding to a stiff position against the formal proceedings, China took the step in December of publishing what amounts to its official legal position but in the form of an unofficial brief to the Tribunal. This sophisticated legal analysis of its prerogative to disregard the arbitration proceedings coincided closely with its deadline for submitting a brief to the Hague tribunal. Regardless of whether the arguments in its December paper will matter to arbitrators in the Hague, their wide publication helps to soften China’s image of bullying, portraying itself as committed to international law without compromising its stance against the Philippines’ call for binding arbitration.

The Philippines wanted Vietnam to formally join its case, while <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/12/us-china-vietnam-idUSKBN0JQ0GA20141212?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews">China lobbied and cajoled Vietnam</a> not to do so. However confident China may be in its own legal arguments (probably more so with regard to the arbitral panel’s jurisdiction than with regard to the merits of the Philippines’ claims), it wants to avoid unified legal positions among smaller regional powers, just as it wants to divide them generally in negotiations. In December, Vietnam took a path somewhere in between. Without becoming party itself to the litigation, it sent a statement to the Permanent Court of Arbitration opposing several of China’s positions in the South China Sea. Vietnam’s statement to the panel reportedly included support for the court’s jurisdiction over the Philippines’ case, asking the court to give due regard to Vietnam’s legal interests in the matter and rejecting China’s nine-dash line. While not committing itself to litigating against China, Vietnam thereby aided its Philippine neighbor, further clarified its own position, perhaps in preparation for a future case of its own, and signaled that smaller regional players are unmoved by China’s efforts to dress up its aggressive maritime maneuvers in non-threatening legal clothes.

The U.S. State Department also <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/234936.pdf">published a December position paper</a>, methodically casting legal doubt on China’s South China Sea claims. The U.S. government wanted to take a legal move that would subtly balance several objectives that are sometime in tension. It sought to avoid taking a hard position on specific, competing sovereignty claims in the South China Sea, but also to signal general support for the Philippines’ position on maritime law. The United States also finds itself in the awkward position of favoring in principle resolution of South China Sea disputes through international legal processes but declining to bind itself to compulsory processes through ratification of UNCLOS. To navigate a path through these policy and diplomatic constraints, the United States published its views without a specific addressee. The position paper – published as the latest in a series of maritime boundary studies – was intended for a regional and global audience, though the U.S. government was clearly aware that it might informally influence arbitrators in the Hague, who are currently scrutinizing the legality of the nine-dash line.

Like China’s paper, the U.S. paper is circulating widely inside foreign ministries and attracting substantial public commentary. It may seem ironic that the Chinese and American legal position papers are getting so much attention, since the former is often criticized for snubbing UNCLOS’s processes and the latter is often criticized for refusing to ratify UNCLOS. It is also appropriate given their power.

The legal moves and countermoves of the Philippines, China, Vietnam, and United States show that formal UNCLOS proceedings do not replace diplomacy. Rather, they add to both its complexity and set of instruments.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Blunting China’s Realpolitik Approach: Liberalism through UNCLOS Arbitration</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The 2012 Scarborough Shoal stand-off between the Philippines and China was the proverbial tipping point caused by China’s pattern of protracted, aggressive actions against the Philippines that began two years earlier. In mid-2010, the Philippine government had observed an increased Chinese naval presence and activities in the country’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), recorded reports of Chinese warships firing at Filipino fishermen, and experienced the harassment of its survey vessel by two Chinese patrol boats while it conducted gas exploration in the Reed Bank. Confronted by an assertive China, the Philippines relies on its commitment to an international law governing the use of the world oceans as a means of settling territorial disputes. Philippine Foreign Secretary Roberto Del Rosario emphasized the importance of this approach when he declared that the “<a href="http://www.gov.ph/2012/05/08/the-secretary-of-foreign-affairs-on-the-30th-anniversary-of-the-unclos-may-8-2012/">UNCLOS has never been more important for the Philippines than today, when overlapping maritime claims threatens as never before the peace and prosperity in our part of the world</a>.” Without any credible military capability to back its diplomacy, for the Philippines, “<a href="http://www.gov.ph/2013/01/22/dfa-guide-q-a-on-the-legal-track-of-the-unclos-arbitral-proceedings/">the legal track presents the most durable option to defend the national interests and territory on the basis of international law</a>.”

From April 9 to June 18, 2012, the Philippines was pitted against China in a tense naval stand-off at the Scarborough Shoal. On April 8, 2012 the Philippine Navy’s (PN’s) flagship, the BRP Gregorio Del Pilar, tried to apprehend several Chinese fishing boats engaged in illegal activities at the Scarborough Shoal. Two Chinese Maritime Surveillance (CMS) vessels arrived and prevented the arrest of the Chinese fishermen who were hauling corals, clams, and live sharks into their boats. The stand-off underscored China’s preferred maritime strategy against the smaller claimant states. This strategy involves “drawing a line” in the sea using civilian vessels to challenge littoral states. This strategy relies on increasing the risk that maritime confrontations will become military, because Beijing keeps People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) ships lurking in the background. During the 2012 stand-off, the Philippines reiterated its proposal to put the dispute over the shoal for arbitration by the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS). The Philippines justified its insistence on a multilateral approach to ensure the freedom of navigation and the unimpeded commerce in the South China Sea, which are fundamental interests of countries worldwide.

In mid-June 2012, after the Philippines withdrew its single coast guard vessels from the area, China became the de facto occupier of the Scarborough Shoal. Crew members of CMS vessels constructed a chain barrier across the mouth of the shoal to block Philippine access to it. China deployed these vessels to protect the fleet of Chinese fishing boats operating deep into the Philippines EEZ. In October 2012, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=WZabBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT160&amp;lpg=PT160&amp;dq=fu+ying+visited+manila+scarborough&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4T0hFRr5yl&amp;sig=Utp4Gm3Brb783kOVOGNov_xqBhU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hcK_VPSjCfbesATWzYHQDg&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=fu%20ying%20visited%20manila%20scarborough&amp;f=false">Chinese Foreign Minister Fu Ying visited Manila</a> to badger the Philippines into accepting in silence China’s exercise of de facto occupation of the Scarborough Shoal.

Philippine officials, however, were not cowed into accepting China’s fait accompli. In January 2013, the Philippines directly confronted Chinese coercive diplomacy by filing a statement of claim against China in the Arbitral Tribunal of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). In its statement of claim, the Philippines made it clear that it does not seek arbitration over which party has sovereignty over the islands claimed by both the Philippines and China. Rather, it merely requests the Arbitral Tribunal to issue an opinion on the following issues: 1) Whether China’s maritime claim in the South China Sea based on its so-called nine-dash line claim is valid or contrary to UNCLOS; and 2) whether Scarborough Shoal, Johnson Reef, Cuarteron Reef, and Fiery Reef, which are submerged features that are below sea level at high tide are islands or rocks under Article 121 (3) of the Convention.

China refused to participate in the international arbitration and openly expressed its opposition to the Philippines’ filing of a case to the arbitral tribunal. On February 20, 2013, the Chinese ambassador in Manila returned the notice of arbitration to the Department of Foreign Affairs. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson in Beijing branded the filing as “factually flawed” and accused Manila of violating the non-binding 2001 Declaration of Conduct of the Parties in the South China Sea which provides for ASEAN and China to settle their maritime disputes among themselves. In April 2013, a visiting Chinese foreign ministry official warned Manila of the consequences of pushing the arbitration process against China. Beijing’s resentment towards Manila became more glaring in November 2013 after it <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/14/typhoon-haiyan-china-aid-philippines-ikea">donated a mere $100, 000</a> to the Philippines after the central part of the country was devastated by Typhoon Yolanda (Haiayan)—a category five typhoon.

The Philippines’ filing statement of claim against China in the Arbitral Tribunal under UNCLOS showed that it won’t be subdued by the latter party’s strong-arm tactic. In doing so, the Philippines is blunting China’s realpolitik approach as it is seeking a multilateral and legal solution to the territorial dispute in the South China Sea, and invoking the international community’s stake in the outcome of this case. The Philippines is showing to the world that the appropriate approach for resolving disputes involving overlapping claims to the global commons should be the liberal, legal approach based on multilateralism and international law, rather than a “might makes right,” realpolitik strategy. It remains to be seen in 2015 and 2016 whether or not this will prevail.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The next stage in the Philippines’ closely-watched arbitration case against China’s maritime claims will come in March when Manila’s lawyers submit their answers to questions posed last month by the five judge panel overseeing the case. The Philippines has put together a clever case, one that seeks to skirt China’s exemptions to compulsory arbitration as allowed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). But the case is not a slam dunk, and that might be for the best.

The heart of the Philippines’ case is an argument that <a href="http://amti.csis.org/atlas/#9dash">China’s infamous nine-dash line</a> does not qualify as a valid maritime claim. If the Arbitral Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction in any part of the case, it is hard to imagine that it will not agree with Manila on this point. And that ruling—that Beijing is legally obligated to lay out its claims based on maritime entitlements from coastlines and islands, not via dashes arbitrarily drawn on a map—could be enormously beneficial for all those with an interest in the South China Sea.

Despite Beijing’s insistence that it will not recognize any award the court makes, China’s leaders might be persuaded to clarify the country’s South China Sea claims even while publicly refusing to obey the court. This would be much the same as how the United States under the George H.W. Bush administration complied with much of an International Court of Justice ruling in a case brought by Nicaragua that the Reagan administration had earlier rebuffed.

Chinese legal experts both inside and outside government already know that Beijing will eventually need to redefine the nine-dash line. In theory, it could maintain a claim to most of the waters within the line by making (admittedly extreme) EEZ and continental shelf claims from the Paracel and Spratly Islands. That is a clarification that the Chinese leadership could live with.

Other parts of the Philippines’ case are more ambitious, more tenuous, and less acceptable to China. Manila has asked the Tribunal to rule that several features occupied by China are in fact low-tide elevations, not islands, and are therefore not open to claims of sovereignty because they are legally part of the seabed. At least one of these features listed by the Philippines appears to lie within the territorial sea of a rock or island claimed by China and is therefore beyond the possible jurisdiction of the court. The court may or may not find it has sufficient evidence to rule on the remaining features, especially because accurate surveys of the Spratlys are notoriously lacking. If the tribunal does rule these features to be low-tide elevations and orders China to evacuate them, it is hard to imagine that Beijing will comply.

But the really troubling outcome of the case could lie with the most ambitious of Manila’s arguments—that a number of islets occupied by China are legally rocks, not islands, and therefore can generate only a 12 nautical mile territorial sea, not an EEZ or continental shelf. In its full memorial submitted to the court last year, the Philippines added Itu Aba, the largest of the Spratlys, to its case. It is unlikely that the court will rule that Itu Aba, and by extension all the smaller islets in the archipelago, are legally rocks—such a ruling would be unprecedented in its scope. More importantly, such a ruling would back Beijing into a legal corner, with worrying results.

Redefining the nine-dash line could be palatable to Beijing, but only if that redefinition leaves China with a substantive claim to EEZs and continental shelves in the South China Sea. If the Philippines gets everything it is asking for from the court, such a clarification would be impossible. In that case, China is all but certain to dig in its heels, doubling down on the nine-dash line and in all likelihood withdrawing from the Law of the Sea convention. This would technically be illegal since the treaty requires advanced warning of such a withdrawal, but at that point, Beijing would be unlikely to care. Provoking such an extreme reaction from China will not be in the Philippines’ interests, nor in those of the other South China Sea claimants, the United States, or the international legal order.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Diplomatic Implications of Philippines-China Arbitration</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When it comes to the South China Sea, the year 2014 was a rollercoaster. With Manila’s arbitration efforts against Beijing gaining momentum, 2015 will present new challenges not only to Philippine-China bilateral relations, but also to <a href="http://amti.csis.org/intense-maneuvers-at-the-hague/">the very credibility</a> of international arbitration bodies under the aegis of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

China kicked off 2014 by introducing <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/CHIN-02-140114.html">new fisheries regulations</a>, placing additional restrictions on the freedom of movement of foreign vessels within Chinese-claimed waters off the coast of Hainan. Over the succeeding months, China <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/second-thomas-shoal-the-new-battleground/">upped the ante</a> by challenging the Philippines’ claim to the Second Thomas Shoal. Chinese paramilitary forces effectively placed a siege on the Filipino marine detachment, which has tenuously guarded the contested shoal for more than a decade. The South China Sea disputes took a turn for the worst, when China brazenly dispatched a giant oil rig into Vietnamese-claimed waters, sparking the <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-great-south-china-sea-clash-china-vs-vietnam-11058">greatest political crisis</a> between the two Communist neighbors.

Towards the end of the year, however, China dialed down territorial tensions, with President Xi Jinping, during the APEC Summit in Beijing, reaching out to his estranged neighbors, especially Japan, Vietnam, and the Philippines. During the ASEAN Summit, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/13/us-myanmar-asean-china-idUSKCN0IX0W920141113">China dangled $20 billion in economic incentives</a> and proposed a hotline as well as a high-level defense dialogue between Beijing and its Southeast Asian counterpart.

Towards the end of the year, however, Philippines’ legal arbitration efforts against China gained momentum, with Washington and Hanoi explicitly criticizing Beijing’s expansive nine-dash line claims and directly and indirectly supporting Manila’s pending case at the Arbitral Tribunal at The Hague. As expected, China missed the December 15 deadline to submit its Counter-Memorial to the arbitration body. Crucially, the Chinese Foreign Ministry, however, released what in many ways constituted an <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1217147.shtml"><em>informal</em> Counter-Memorial</a>, publishing a position paper, which detailed Beijing’s rationale for boycotting the arbitration procedures.

From the perspective of the Filipino leadership, a favorable arbitration outcome will produce sufficient diplomatic pressure to dissuade China from further territorial adventurism within the Philippines’ 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Yet, there is little guarantee that the Philippines’ strategy will pay off. Many in the Philippines are concerned about the <a href="http://www.interaksyon.com/article/98825/ambassador-sees-stronger-philippine-china-relations-under-chinas-five-year-development-plan">opportunity costs of and additional risks</a> presented by the its decision to initiate compulsory arbitration under Article 287 and Annex VII of UNCLOS against China. China, a signatory to the UNCLOS, has exercised its right under Article 298 to absolve itself of any compulsory arbitration over issues concerning maritime delimitation and territorial sovereignty.

The Arbitral Tribunal doesn’t have the mandate to ascertain sovereignty-related issues. Yet, the Philippines’ memorial primarily focuses on the determination of the nature of disputed features under Article 121 in question; specifically, whether they can be appropriated by any sovereign nation and/or generate their own territorial waters. More importantly, in its case the Philippines is directly questioning the validity of China’s nine-dash line using UNCLOS as the primary reference point for maritime delimitation issues. China, <a href="http://csis.org/publication/pacnet-3-historic-fishing-rights-and-nine-dash-line-response-pacnet-88-1">as some observers argue</a>, may in fact have a right to non-exclusionary, joint exploitation of fisheries resources across the South China Sea. But China has not yet clarified the precise coordinates and legal implications of its expansive territorial claims. The Philippines’ arbitration efforts could, at best, force China to further clarify its nine-dash line doctrine.

The Arbitral Tribunal has the mandate to determine whether the Philippines’ case falls under its jurisdiction, despite China’s refusal to subject itself to compulsory arbitration. But it faces a “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” conundrum. Without any compliance-enforcement mechanism, the arbitration body, if it chooses to push ahead with the proceedings, could end up being entirely ignored by the losing party, particularly if that party is China. An estranged China, intent on appeasing its domestic nationalist constituency, could also opt for withdrawing from the UNCLOS altogether.

On the other hand, if the Arbitral Tribunal projects coyness on the issue, refusing to decisively push ahead with the arbitral proceedings, the very credibility of the UNCLOS will be called into question. Over the coming months, the Philippines is expected to <a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/12/18/1404065/intl-tribunal-seeks-more-arguments-philippines">submit additional arguments</a> to the arbitral body, which will have to decide whether the proceedings can move ahead in absence of China’s participation.

The bigger issue, however, is the state of bilateral relations between the Philippines and China. Arguably, the Philippines’ unprecedented decision to take China to the court over the ongoing territorial disputes has had a <a href="http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-05/14/content_15282715.htm">negative impact on bilateral trade and investment relations</a>, with <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-bypasses-philippines-in-its-proposed-maritime-silk-road-1415636066">Beijing seemingly withholding large-scale investments</a> from the Southeast Asian country.

While China stands as a leading source of capital and affordable technology to developing countries around the world, the Philippines, quite astonishingly, has had <a href="http://business.inquirer.net/173975/feuding-china-ph-can-still-do-business-envoy">more direct investments in China</a>, than the other way around. By some accounts, the Philippines is <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-bypasses-philippines-in-its-proposed-maritime-silk-road-1415636066">deliberately excluded</a> from China’s ambitious Maritime Silk Road initiative. With the exception of the Philippines, China is also the top trading partner of almost all East Asian economies.

More importantly, there is hardly any sustained, formal high-level dialogue between the two countries, especially above the ambassadorial level. Since Xi Jinping’s ascent to power, the Philippines is yet to host the Chinese president, premiere, or even foreign minister. While China, has <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/david-vs-goliath-the-south-china-sea-the-philippines-vs-11534">worked on</a> confidence building measures with Vietnam and Japan, the Philippines is yet to negotiate a single hotline with its Chinese counterparts. In short, diplomatic ties have been frozen amid the arbitration showdown.

As the host of the 2015 APEC Summit, the Philippines has the unique opportunity to welcome the Chinese leadership, paving the way for reviving top-level diplomatic channels. With President Aquino expected to step down in 2016, China is also looking forward to a ‘diplomatic reset’ with the succeeding Philippine administration. It remains to be seen, however, how both parties could transcend their bitter and dramatic disagreements over the arbitration proceedings.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction</strong>

The arbitration case launched by the Philippines against China currently stands as the most significant, and most closely watched, development for specialists and observers of the maritime disputes in the South China Sea (SCS). To help observers navigate through this foggy proceeding, this article attempts to provide a focused overview of the arbitration case and developments in the bilateral dispute between the two parties.

<strong>Preludes</strong>

Although the territorial and maritime issues in the SCS have technically been in existence since the 1930s, the case of the Philippines against China is a direct result of very recent events arising out of the long-festering dispute between the two countries. In the aftermath of tensions between the Philippines and China over the latter’s facilities in Mischief Reef in 1999 and the conclusion of a maritime delimitation between China and Vietnam in the Gulf of Tonkin, a modus vivendi was reached with the signing of the <a href="http://www.asean.org/asean/external-relations/china/item/declaration-on-the-conduct-of-parties-in-the-south-china-sea">2002 Declaration of Conduct</a> of Parties in the SCS (DOC). By 2005 it appeared that relations between the parties had stabilized enough that their national oil companies entered into a Joint Marine Seismic Undertaking that was implemented <a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/72480/joint-exploration-pact-lapses">until 2008</a>. Relations took a downturn, however, in 2009 when submissions were made (one <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/submission_mysvnm_33_2009.htm">by Vietnam and Malaysia jointly</a>, and another <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/submission_vnm_37_2009.htm">by Vietnam alone</a>) for areas of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles in the SCS <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part6.htm">in accordance with UNCLOS</a>. These immediately prompted <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/mysvnm33_09/chn_2009re_mys_vnm_e.pdf">China's protest</a> and first official publication of its SCS claim known as the so-called nine dashed line, which was followed by a sharp exchange of diplomatic notes. The tussle was thereafter followed by a string of increasingly risky confrontations at sea.

On the Philippine side, the SCS disputes came to the attention of the fledgling Presidential administration with an <a href="http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=37902#.VL3DRGSUe1Q">incident in 2011</a> involving interference by China Maritime Surveillance ships with a Philippine seismic survey ship at Reed Bank. Soon after, <a href="http://www.epmag.com/palawan-gas-development-sparks-chinese-protest-669541">China lodged a diplomatic protest</a> against the Philippines’ <a href="http://www.doe.gov.ph/microsites/pecr4/">public auction of petroleum concession blocks</a> which included two areas between Reed Bank and the Philippine island of Palawan. The Philippines subsequently lodged <a href="http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/222526/news/nation/dfa-conveys-protest-to-beijing-over-chinese-vessels">its own diplomatic protests</a> against China’s <a href="http://csis.org/files/publication/110629_Thayer_South_China_Sea.pdf">fishing and military activities</a> in Reed Bank and nearby areas. Relations increasingly became strained as China’s press openly <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/25/us-china-seas-idUSTRE79O1MV20111025">warned of military action</a>, spurring an <a href="http://www.interaksyon.com/article/16014/dfa-chief-china-papers-comments-on-spratlys-row-irresponsible">official response</a> from the Philippines. The exchange of protests <a href="http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/01/08/12/ph-protests-chinas-new-intrusions-west-ph-sea">continued</a> well into the first quarter of 2012. Tensions between the two countries reached a head in April that year with a <a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/36003/scarborough-shoal-standoff-a-historicaltimeline/">months-long confrontation</a> between Philippine and Chinese vessels at Scarborough Shoal, which ended when Philippine ships left the shoal upon a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/19/world/asia/beijing-and-manila-ease-tensions-in-south-china-sea.html?_r=0">reported agreement</a> for mutual withdrawal in June 2012. Shortly after, however, Chinese vessels returned and have since been <a href="http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/305062/news/world/a-year-after-panatag-stand-off-shoal-firmly-controlled-by-china">in control of the shoal</a>.

<strong>Launching the Case</strong>

On January 23, 2013, the Philippine <a href="http://www.dfa.gov.ph/index.php/2013-06-27-21-50-36/unclos">announced</a> that it initiated an arbitration case against China by issuing a <a href="http://www.dfa.gov.ph/index.php/component/docman/doc_download/56-notification-and-statement-of-claim-on-west-philippine-sea?Itemid=546">Notification and Statement of Claim</a> in accordance with the dispute settlement provisions of UNCLOS, particularly under <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part15.htm">Art. 287</a> and <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/annex7.htm">Annex VII</a>. Both the Philippines and China are signatories to UNCLOS, having ratified it in <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_declarations.htm#Philippines%20Understanding made upon signature (10 December 1982) and confirmed upon ratification">1984</a> and <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_declarations.htm#China%20Upon ratification">2006</a> respectively.

UNCLOS provides for numerous means of <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part15.htm">peaceful settlement of maritime disputes</a>, which include <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part15.htm">non-binding means</a> between the disputing parties and <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part15.htm">binding means</a> involving third parties such as arbitration and adjudication. While all States may resort to any of the non-binding means at any time, Art. 287(3) requires them to select their preferred binding means involving third parties. If they do not do so, they are deemed to have selected arbitration under UNCLOS Annex VII as the mode of dispute settlement. Any selection, however, is subject to certain <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part15.htm">express limitations under Art. 297(2) and 297(3) and/or optional exceptions under Art. 298(1)</a>.

Since neither the Philippines nor China expressed any preferred third-party dispute settlement mechanism in their ratifications, both are deemed to have selected arbitration as the means to settle maritime disputes between them concerning the interpretation and application of UNCLOS, unless any of the express limitations and optional exceptions are applicable.

China formally <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/20/world/asia/china-rejects-un-arbitration-of-maritime-dispute.html">rejected</a> the Notification and Statement of Claim and returned it to the Philippines on February 19, 2013. However, under <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/annex7.htm">Art. 9 of UNCLOS Annex VII</a>, the absence of a party or its failure to defend the case does not bar the proceedings.

<a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/annex7.htm">Art. 3 of UNCLOS Annex VII</a> provides for constitution of a five-member arbitral tribunal. The Philippines began the process through the nomination of Rudiger Wolfrum as arbitrator in its Notification and Statement of Claim. China had 30 days to likewise nominate one arbitrator, but did not do so in light of its rejection of the arbitration. Normally, the arbitral tribunal is constituted upon mutual agreement of the parties to the case, but light of the rejection and refusal of China to participate, Annex VII authorizes the President of the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), upon request of the initiating party, to appoint the arbitrator on its behalf. This was done with the appointment of ITLOS judge Stanislav Polack as the <a href="http://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/press_releases_english/PR_191_E.pdf">second tribunal member</a> on March 25, 2013. Subsequently, likewise upon request of the Philippines, the President of ITLOS appointed the <a href="http://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/press_releases_english/PR_191_E.pdf">remaining three members of the tribunal</a>, namely Jean-Pierre Cot, Chris Pinto, and Alfred Soons. Chris Pinto was subsequently <a href="http://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/press_releases_english/PR_197_E.pdf">replaced</a> by Thomas Mensah, who was also appointed President of the Tribunal on June 24, 2013.

The Tribunal subsequently <a href="http://www.pca-cpa.org/showfile.asp?fil_id=2311">met</a> for the first time at the Peace Palace in The Hague on July 11, 2013. China <a href="http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag_id=1529">reiterated</a> its rejection of the proceedings in a Note to the Tribunal on August 1. The Tribunal thereafter issued its <a href="http://www.pca-cpa.org/showfile.asp?fil_id=2311">first Procedural Order</a> on August 27. The Order designated the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) to act as registry of the proceedings, and adopted the Tribunal’s <a href="http://www.pca-cpa.org/showfile.asp?fil_id=2504">Rules of Procedure</a> and initial timetable. The Tribunal is actually a separate entity and independent of either the ITLOS or the PCA; by being the registry, the PCA primarily hosts the tribunal and provides its administrative support.

<strong>The Substantial Stage</strong>

Likewise in its first Procedural Order, the Tribunal fixed March 30, 2014 as the date on which the Philippines was to submit its Memorial, which is the principal pleading stating its case in full. The Philippines was asked to fully address all the issues, including matters relating to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal the admissibility of its claims, and the merits of the dispute.

Pending submission of the Memorial, tensions between the parties continued to rise. In mid-2013, the Philippines <a href="http://apdforum.com/en_GB/article/rmiap/articles/online/features/2013/05/30/philippines-china-protest">noted and protested</a> the increased frequency and proximity of China Maritime Surveillance ships around its outpost the Second Thomas Shoal, as well as the reported blocking of a Philippine civilian vessel on its way to Pag-asa Island. Concrete blocks <a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/84953/75-blocks-found-in-shoal/">found</a> by a surveillance flight to Scarborough Shoal were mistaken to be preparations for a permanent Chinese facility on the reef; they were <a href="http://www.malaya.com.ph/business-news/news/concrete-blocks-or-just-rocks-latest-twist-panatag-issue">later determined</a> to be from previous and long-forgotten wrecks. In January and February 2013, it was reported that <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/24/us-philippines-southchinasea-idUSBREA1N0F820140224">Chinese ships had used water cannon</a> against Philippine fishing boats. The most serious incident occurred in March, just prior to the deadline for submission of the Memorial, when China Maritime Surveillance ships <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/03/second-thomas-shoal-tensions-intensify/">prevented a Philippine Navy ship</a> from re-supplying and replacing personnel on its outpost on Second Thomas Shoal. Several weeks later, another ship with journalists on board <a href="http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/specials/sierra-madre">successfully evaded</a> Chinese ships blocking its path and was able to carry out the resupply and personnel rotation.

On March 30, 2014, the <a href="https://www.dfa.gov.ph/index.php/2013-06-27-21-50-36/dfa-releases/2460-statement-of-secretary-albert-f-del-rosario-on-the-submission-of-the-philippines-memorial-to-the-arbitral-tribunal">Philippines submitted</a> to the Tribunal and China a lengthy Memorial, which is not public but reportedly comprises 4,000 pages of arguments, documents, and maps. The Tribunal thereafter convened on May 14, and <a href="http://www.pca-cpa.org/showfile.asp?fil_id=2638">gave China until December 15 to submit</a> its Counter-Memorial in response to the Philippines. However, China <a href="http://www.pca-cpa.org/showfile.asp?fil_id=2638">reiterated that it did not accept</a> the arbitration proceedings in a note to the Tribunal on May 21

Meanwhile, since 2012, South China Sea issues have prompted the Philippines to renew and strengthen its military alliance with the United States. Several months of negotiations culminated in the signing in April 2014 of the Philippines-US <a href="http://www.gov.ph/2014/04/29/document-enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement/">Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement</a> (EDCA), to supplement existing arrangements with the US for mutual logistics support and visiting forces. The agreement was signed just in time for a brief visit of U.S. President Barack Obama to Manila on his official tour of Asia. It is intended to assist the Philippines in modernizing its armed forces and developing its capabilities, particularly in the areas of maritime security and maritime domain awareness.

Subsequently, in May 2014, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2014/05/philippines-seizes-chinese-boat-dispute-20145710543690943.html">the Philippines arrested</a> a group of Chinese and Filipino fishermen engaged in an illegal trade of 500 endangered marine turtles at Half-Moon Shoal, which is even closer to the Philippines than Second Thomas Shoal but also claimed by China. <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/57520-china-demand-release-fishermen-ph">China accused the Philippines of provocation and demanded the release</a> of its fishermen. This was followed by the <a href="http://www.dfa.gov.ph/index.php/2013-06-27-21-50-36/dfa-releases/2871-china-s-reclamation-on-mabini-reef">release of surveillance photographs of land reclamation</a> taking place on a massive scale and at rapid pace on Johnson South Reef. Similar activities have been reported on Cuarteron Reef, McKennan Reef, and Gaven Reef. Subsequently, <a href="http://www.janes.com/article/46083/china-building-airstrip-capable-island-on-fiery-cross-reef">similar reclamation was confirmed</a> in Fiery Cross Reef. Despite the Philippines’ <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1532473/philippines-files-fourth-protest-over-china-reef-reclamation-disputed">repeated protests</a>, the reclamation activities continue unabated.

As <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/vietnam-china-dispute-heats-south-china-sea-oil-rig-begins-drilling-photo-1590372">China deployed an oil rig</a> off the coast of Vietnam in the same month, the Philippines called for a moratorium on all activities that created tensions. This was later formally proposed as the first and immediate part of a “<a href="http://www.dfa.gov.ph/index.php/2013-06-27-21-50-36/dfa-releases/3729-dfa-statement-on-the-philippine-proposal-triple-action-plan">Triple Action Plan</a>” to manage the territorial and maritime disputes. The second involves full implementation of the 2002 DOC and conclusion of a regional Code of Conduct, while the third proposes the establishment of a binding dispute settlement mechanism. <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-rejects-philippine-proposal-on-south-china-sea-disputes-1407574262">China rejected</a> this proposal.

Tensions began to ease somewhat as the year drew to a close. In November 2014, Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III and Chinese President Xi Jinping <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/president-aquino-philippines-meets-chinas-xi-apec-ice-breaker-n245981">met for the first time</a> on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Beijing. However, the December 15 deadline for submission of China’s Counter-Memorial had some unexpected results that were technically outside of the proceedings.

<strong>External Events</strong>

On December 5, the United States released <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/234936.pdf">an official report</a> which analysed China’s claims to the SCS, and declared that its nine-dash line claim could only be internationally acceptable as a claim to territorial sovereignty over the islands inside the lines. Insofar as the waters beyond those islands is concerned, the claims could only be valid if made in accordance with UNCLOS. The State Department paper criticized China’s ambiguity over the nature of its claims, and denied the validity of its claims to historic title or historic rights that it sometimes expresses in official statements.

At the same time, Vietnam quietly submitted a <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1661364/china-rejects-vietnam-claims-arbitration-submission-over-south-china-sea">confidential statement</a> to the Tribunal regarding the case. Vietnam stated that it requested the Tribunal to pay due regard to the legal rights and interests of Vietnam, but recognized the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the case and supported the Philippines’ arguments against the legality of China’s nine-dash line claim. The statement has not been released to the public.

Two days later, China publicly <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1217147.shtml">released a position paper</a> outlining its objections to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal while reiterating that it was not participating in the proceedings. It asserted that the case was essentially founded on the issue of sovereignty over the islands and other maritime features in the SCS, and that even if the Tribunal were to disregard these sovereignty questions, it could not decide on the Philippine claims without first undertaking maritime delimitations. This meant that either way, the case falls outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction since it is within the optional exceptions to the jurisdiction of binding dispute settlement mechanisms that China invoked in a <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_declarations.htm#China%20Upon ratification">2006 declaration</a> in accordance with the terms of <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part15.htm">UNCLOS Art. 298(1)</a>. China also argued that the Philippines was acting in bad faith and abusing its rights under the UNCLOS by unilaterally taking China to arbitration.

<strong>Status of the Proceedings as of January 2015</strong>

On December 17, 2014, the Tribunal issued its third <a href="http://www.pca-cpa.org/showfile.asp?fil_id=2846">Procedural Order</a>. It recorded that China did not submit a Counter-Memorial, and reiterated its decision to neither accept nor participate in the arbitration. The Tribunal acknowledged that its members had been furnished with copies of China’s public position paper while noting that it also expressly stated that the position paper should not be regarded as acceptance or participation in the proceedings.
<blockquote>In accordance with its Rules of Procedure, the Tribunal gave the Philippines until March 15, 2015 to submit a supplemental submission on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and the merits of the case, in particular to address the points raised by China’s position paper. After the submission, China will have a similar period of 90 days within which to file a response.</blockquote>
The Tribunal also acknowledged receipt of Vietnam’s statement.

<strong>The Philippine Claims</strong>

The <a href="http://www.dfa.gov.ph/index.php/component/docman/doc_download/56-notification-and-statement-of-claim-on-west-philippine-sea?Itemid=546">Notification and Statement of Claim</a> of the Philippines contains numerous claims against China, but these can all be summarized briefly into the following major groups:

First, the Philippines asserts that China is claiming rights and entitlements far in excess of what has been agreed upon by the international community in UNCLOS. These excessive claims are signified by the nine-dash line map, which China has invoked against the Philippines to justify its claims to sovereignty, jurisdiction, historic title, or historic rights over maritime areas or activities within those lines. The Philippine argues that China’s claims to maritime rights or entitlements based on the nine-dash line map are contrary to UNCLOS and invalid. However, it acknowledges that any issues regarding sovereignty over the land features within those lines are not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and therefore does not seek a ruling from the Tribunal on those issues.

Second, the Philippines argues that China has illegally occupied or controlled eight features within the SCS. Specifically, it occupies Fiery Cross, Cuarteron, Subi, McKennan, Johnson South, Gaven, and Mischief Reefs, and has taken exclusive control of Scarborough Shoal. The Philippines argues this is based on illegitimate claims to title or sovereignty over completely submerged areas, or historic rights to living and non-living natural resources, including control of maritime navigation. It argues further that China has claimed excessive maritime rights and entitlements from these maritime features that it presently occupies or controls, which should be governed by <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part8.htm">Art. 121 of UNCLOS</a>.

<a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Maritime-Zones.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2761" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Maritime-Zones-1024x592.jpg" alt="Maritime Zones" width="640" height="370" /></a>

At various instances, China has prevented the Philippines from lawfully exploring and exploiting the marine resources within or around these reefs. It is argued that China’s actions against Philippine ships and activities around these areas, and indeed throughout the area within the nine-dash line, assert claims to rights and entitlements far beyond those allowed under Art. 121. The Philippines acknowledges that at most, Scarborough, Johnson South, Cuarteron, and Fiery Cross reefs may be entitled to 12 nautical mile territorial sea zones on account of rocky protrusions above water at high tide, but no more; China’s claims or activities beyond this distance from the features are illegal in international law. The remaining occupied features do not generate any maritime zones at all, and therefore they are on the seabed that are parts of the Philippines’ continental shelf and subject to the latter’s exclusive rights and jurisdictions under UNCLOS.

Third, the Philippines asserts that China has unlawfully claimed rights or entitlements to, and unlawfully exploited living and non-living natural resources in other areas within the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone and/or Continental Shelf, while preventing the latter from doing so. It is also asserted that China has unlawfully interfered with its rights to navigation under UNCLOS. The Philippines argues that China’s claim based on the nine-dash line map cuts off and deprives the Philippines of its maritime entitlements to those maritime zones under international law.

The Philippine jurisdictional zones in the South China Sea are collectively and officially described in Philippine domestic parlance as the <a href="http://www.gov.ph/2012/09/05/administrative-order-no-29-s-2012/">West Philippine Sea</a>. The term “West Philippine Sea” is used by the Philippines to refer to the maritime areas within its sovereignty or jurisdiction in accordance with UNCLOS, and is located within the geographic area of the South China Sea but directly adjacent to its islands.

On the basis of these arguments, which are likely dealt with in great detail in the lengthy but still confidential Memorial, the Philippines seeks reliefs in the form of a number of declarations and orders from the Tribunal. The most important of these is a declaration of invalidity under international law of China’s claims based on the nine-dash line map, and that China’s maritime rights and entitlements can only be those based on UNCLOS. Other reliefs sought include a declaration that China’s occupation and facilities on the various reefs are illegal, as well as an order for China to end its occupation thereof. It is also requested for the Tribunal to order China to bring its domestic legislation in accordance with UNCLOS, and stop preventing Philippine vessels from lawfully exploring and exploiting the natural resources of the area, as well as any other activities inconsistent with UNCLOS. The Philippines also asks the Tribunal to declare that the Philippines is fully entitled to its 12 nautical mile territorial sea and 200 nautical mile EEZ and continental shelf measured from its <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/doalos_publications/LOSBulletins/bulletinpdf/bulletin70e.pdf">archipelagic baselines</a> as enacted in 2009.

<strong>China’s Counter-Arguments</strong>

The <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1217147.shtml">position paper</a> released by China on December 7, 2014 deals only with the issue of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and does not delve into the merits of the Philippine case. From China’s standpoint, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the case filed by the Philippines mainly on the following procedural and substantive grounds:

First, China asserts that the subject matter of the arbitration is, at its core, a dispute over territorial sovereignty over the various features of the Spratly Islands and Scarborough Shoal. China claims absolute sovereignty over those features on various historical and legal grounds, contrary to the Philippines own claims to some of those features. It argues that unless the question of sovereignty over those features is first determined, the issue of who may lawfully exercise the maritime rights and entitlements around them cannot be resolved: the issue of sovereignty over the land and rights over the adjacent seas are inseparable. Since the issue of territorial sovereignty has been expressly excluded by the Philippines from the case, China concludes that it cannot have jurisdiction over the dispute.

Second, China argues that even if the Tribunal could resolve the maritime dispute without dealing with the question of sovereignty over the adjacent land features, it cannot decide on the Philippines’ claims without first undertaking a maritime delimitation. China points to the geography of the area, which aside from the features it currently occupies and included in the case, contains numerous other features such as large islands and other rocks above high tide, including the largest island Itu Aba. China argues that the Philippine case dissects the Spratly island group, distorts the nature and scope of the dispute between the two parties, and avoids questions as to the validity of the Philippines’ own claims to some of the islands; these show that the geographic extent of the Philippines own maritime jurisdiction is still undetermined, and therefore its own claims cannot be decided upon by the Tribunal.

Third, building on the two previous arguments, China invokes the optional exclusion from jurisdiction under Art. 298, which China exercised through its 2006 declaration. It argues that the right granted to States to exercise this optional exclusion, and the complementary prerogative of States to choose the means for settlement of disputes under <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part15.htm">Art. 299</a>, would be rendered meaningless. China views the action of the Philippines of unilaterally initiating arbitration as an abuse of the compulsory dispute settlement procedures of UNCLOS. In addition, China also sees it as contravening existing agreements between China and the Philippines, such as the 2002 DOC, to seek a negotiated solution, and other agreements reached between the two countries throughout the 1990s meant to improve the relations between them, as well as the entire region, in spite of the dispute. China further asserts that the actions of the Philippines as a whole to be in bad faith because it seeks a maritime delimitation in disguise, and ignores the need for the two countries to resolve the issues in dispute directly through negotiations.

<strong>What Next?</strong>

Since arbitration was launched in January 2013, incidents over disputes territories and in disputed waters have continued, and we might expect these to do so for the foreseeable future despite legal proceedings. But there may also be opportunities for reducing tensions and minimizing the risk of escalation if incidents do arise. A number of flashpoints for either conflict or cooperation may be considered:
<ul>
	<li>The Philippines will surely make a supplemental submission as requested by the Tribunal in order to address the points raised in China’s position paper. Its counsel has welcomed the position paper as providing <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/78464-reichler-statement-scs-developments">concrete targets</a> for future proceedings.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The Philippines will continue supplying its positions and personnel based in the Spratly Island group, but without moving to maintain or repair damaged facilities and equipment in order to maintain the moral high ground in the arbitration. However, given the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/10/27/south-china-sea/">precarious state</a> of the derelict ship that it uses as an outpost on Second Thomas Shoal, there is a possibility of an incident should the ship’s structure finally yield to the unforgiving sea. Maritime encounters involving interference, and even collision, with Philippine ships are also still possible.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>As the Philippines continues to receive assistance and support in maritime capabilities from countries like the <a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/05/30/1329090/40m-philippine-maritime-capability-us-priority">U.S.</a> and <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/590453/patrol-boats-from-japan-to-start-arriving-in-2015">Japan</a>, it will continue to create as great a presence in maritime law enforcement as it can with its limited assets. It can be expected to pursue fishery enforcement patrols by military or civilian services. The possibility remains that Chinese fishermen will be arrested and brought to trial, especially in cases of marine environmental and fishery offenses in the near-shore areas. In light of China’s more assertive and proactive protection of its fishermen, this will be a likely source of new tensions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Since 2012, China has reportedly been organizing and mobilizing its civilian fishing fleet into a <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jul/18/inside-china-armed-fishermen/?page=all">maritime militia</a>. Such a militia could also extend its range through China’s artificial islands, and the concentration of such a fleet increases the possibility of even more incidents between them and fishers of other countries, as civilian militias could be expected to have a little less discipline and act more unexpectedly than trained armed forces.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>China’s reclamation activities are expected to resume or continue at their very <a href="http://www.janes.com/article/39716/china-goes-all-out-with-major-island-building-project-in-spratlys">rapid pace</a> since 2014, and it is likely that at least one of these new artificial islands will achieve an interim operational capability that will give China round-the-clock and year-long maritime surveillance initially within the Spratly region, and later in the whole nine-dash line area. Enforcement capability will follow thereafter, as surveillance will allow China to more efficiently allocate and utilize its maritime enforcement fleet. Surveillance coverage and efficient enforcement could also lead to confrontations taking place in new areas within the Spratly region that previously had not been the scene of such activities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://rt.com/news/204623-us-china-nonaggression-pact/">conclusion of talks</a> between the US and China for a <a href="http://www.defense.gov/pubs/141112_MemorandumOfUnderstandingRegardingRules.pdf">MOU</a> establishing rules for safety in air and naval encounters may serve as a model for the initiation of similar arrangements between the Philippines and China. There is a need for such an arrangement given the recent history of encounters between Philippine and Chinese ships in the disputed areas.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Activities implementing the EDCA signed last April 2014 will likely commence sometime in 2015, unless the Philippine Supreme Court rules against its constitutionality, or directs that it be subject to Senate ratification, in the case <a href="http://www.fsi.gov.ph/eyes-on-the-prize-philippines-us-alliance-and-defense-modernization-by-julio-s-amador-iii-issue-12-december-2014/">currently pending</a> before it. EDCA is envisioned to play an important role in the modernization of the Philippine armed forces, including the maritime services. Initial plans for the agreement included the <a href="http://news.usni.org/2014/04/29/new-defense-agreement-philippines-u-s-basics">development of Oyster Bay</a> in Palawan as a naval base directly accessible to Reed Bank and the disputed areas. If it pushes through, it may become another irritant in relations between the parties even though it is entirely within the Philippine archipelago.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The consortium that owns Service Contract 72 on a concession area in Reed Bank has announced that <a href="http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/362129/economy/agricultureandmining/philex-petroleum-unit-plans-to-drill-in-disputed-waters-even-without-partner">it will undertake drilling operations by 2016</a>. The consortium attempted to negotiate an agreement with China in order to proceed with petroleum operations, but to date, the political aspects of the dispute have hindered commercial imperatives. However, financial and management considerations may drive a decision to drill, as the consortium may have already made commitments to its investors since 2010 when the service contract was awarded.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The Philippines will <a href="http://business.inquirer.net/181795/ph-starts-rolling-out-red-carpet-for-hosting-of-2015-apec">host APEC</a> in December 2015. Given the tentative steps toward at least a more normal relationship demonstrated in the Aquino-Xi meeting last year, and with the arbitration now in full stride, some room may finally be generated for reaching at least a new modus vivendi that reduces the possibility of sudden escalating conflict. This, however, depends very much on diplomatic initiatives and greater sensitivity to the prevention of untoward incidents.</li>
</ul>
As these and other events unfold, the arbitration will keep apace with the timetable established by the Tribunal. Assuming that the Philippines submits its supplemental pleading in response to China’s position paper on the March 15 deadline, the Tribunal will wait another 90 days for China to submit a rejoinder, no matter how unlikely it may be for such to be given. This means that the next major milestone will be reached in the middle of June 2015.

A ruling on the jurisdictional issue may be expected anytime within 3 to 6 months after the middle of June 2015. This is on account of the importance of the crucial issue of jurisdiction, the pace at which the Tribunal has proceeded thus far, and assuming that a hearing on oral arguments is not called for, and that Vietnam’s statement does not result in additional proceedings. The latter depends largely on the results of consultations on the matter. This ruling will determine whether the case will terminate at this stage or proceed any further.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What’s in a CBM?: Watching for Direct and Indirect Measures of Confidence</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s hard to imagine that the risk of war in Asia could hinge on something as pedestrian and mundane-sounding as “confidence-building measures” or CBMs. Yet this obscure piece of security terminology, originating during the Cold War, is now front and center in discussions of the future of U.S.-China strategic relations.

Policymakers and military leaders in both Washington and Beijing are now making much of the question of what exactly constitutes a meaningful CBM. A public relations skirmish is underway about whether the other side is genuinely trying to build “confidence” and thus reduce the risk of conflict, or merely using loose undertakings about military diplomacy to mask unchanged stances of assertiveness or deterrence.

Strikingly, recent months have brought something of a subtle reversal of positions on this score. It was not so long ago that the United States and its allies and partners were regularly chastising China for refusing to engage in proper, practical CBMs, such as operational channels of communication or rules for encounters at sea. The Chinese position appeared to be that by undertaking CBMs, as with other forms of transparency, they would risk revealing their relative weakness, or alternately let slip that acts of maritime assertiveness were not incidents or accidents but rather part of a strategy to change the status quo.

Yet just as growing capability has allowed the PLA Navy and other Chinese maritime security actors to acquire one kind of confidence – boldness and self-assurance – so too has the Chinese security establishment in general been more willing to countenance another kind of confidence: making seemingly-generous offers of CBMs. This was underlined by developments in November last year, when Beijing signaled a willingness to reopen dialogue on a security hotline with Japan and, significantly, Xi Jinping signed a set of military confidence-building agreements with Barack Obama.

The question, however, remains <a href="http://amti.csis.org/a-2015-resolution-for-risk-reduction/">how serious the Chinese are</a> about following through. Which brings us to the latest and very public diplomatic spat between Beijing and Washington about the choreography of reaching fine-tuned agreement on preventing aerial encounters and, reportedly, a U.S. Navy “goodwill” visit to China by, of all the possible vehicles of diplomacy, an aircraft carrier. <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/pentagon-puts-china-military-exchange-on-hold-1422474327">According to reports</a> that Chinese military representatives publicly deny, the United States is holding back on such visits, and other aspects of the new kind of military relationship the PLA wants, until China follows through on turning risk-reduction agreements into reality.

If this was the first test of Chinese seriousness in trying to reduce risks of accidental military clashes, then it is time to begin wondering whether the November agreements were more a publicity stunt than a genuine policy departure.

As I’ve argued <a href="http://www.lowyinstitute.org/files/pubfiles/Medcalf_and_Heinrichs%2C_Crisis_and_confidence-revised.pdf">in earlier research</a> on the subject, CBMs can be categorized in various ways, but most usefully as being either “direct” or “indirect” in character. A port visit by a foreign navy, even when it involves bilateral exercises, is ultimately just an indirect CBM: a form of engagement or cooperation that is geographically remote from and only indirectly related to the main zones, issues, or capabilities of contention and concern.

Such indirect CBMs are decidedly less effective at reducing near-term risks of tension or conflict than are what I would call direct CBMs: measures that are immediately related to contested zones, contentious issues, and threatening capabilities. Negotiating and implementing a set of rules for preventing fast-moving aerial encounters from escalating into conflict is infinitely more important than ship visits -- which can be almost as much about mutual intelligence-gathering as about winning hearts and minds.

It’s still a step forward that China is talking the talk on CBMs. But already, 2015 has got off to a less than promising start on this critical matter.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The first month of 2015 has witnessed a slow thawing of China-Japan relations. Following up their Beijing summit meeting in November of 2014, the two Asian giants resumed two maritime security talks in January of 2015 – one <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/901538.shtml">between their two defense departments</a>, and the other <a href="http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0001876958">working level diplomatic talks</a> between the governments. So far there is no sign that China and Japan will quickly progress with a substantive deal, given their long-standing mutual suspicions, friction, and arguments. The resumption of the talks, however, represents the return of diplomatic pragmatism in dealing with their protracted disagreements over the East China Sea.

The defense officers meeting, which commenced on January 12-13, is a trial balloon to see if the militaries can repair their ties since contact was fully broken in June 2012. Participants on both sides are low-level officers responsible for military-to-military relations. The media has reported that China and Japan are close to a deal on establishing an at-sea hotline, but this is not a breakthrough. As early as 2010, maritime tensions between Beijing and Tokyo arose from the detention of a Chinese trawler captain and compelled both sides to seek a maritime communication mechanism to prevention conflict escalation. By June 2012, both militaries were close to a deal to build an emergency communication mechanism. Unfortunately, after the Noda Administration’s decision to “nationalize” the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands, and China’s intrusion into the islands’ territorial waters with surveillance boats, progress on the deal ceased entirely.

An additional round of “<a href="http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0001876958">working level talks</a>” by senior officials from both countries, also took place at Yokohama on January 22-23, however, and this channel is more intriguing. The talks, composed of multiple departmental officials from both sides, are aimed at addressing China-Japan animosity in the East China Sea, and strive to mitigate their maritime disputes. If the talks continue, they will be a promising pathway to rebuilding the “consensual process” in the East China Sea contestation.

Beijing and Tokyo have distance between them on numerous issues, including the sovereignty dispute over the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands, EEZ delimitations, specification of joint development zones, fishing administration, and military surveillance in unclarified EEZ areas. The worst part of the China-Japan contest is their overlapping Air Defense Identity Zones (ADIZ). Japan has condemned Beijing for being unilateral and provocative in its first ADIZ announcement in the East China Sea in November, 2013. Obviously, Beijing’s decision to establish an ADIZ that covers disputed Diaoyu/Senkaku air space is a way to forcefully escalate pressure vis-à-vis Japan in return for Tokyo’s consistent refusal to admit the existence of a maritime territorial dispute between two countries, which in turn means the issue cannot be negotiated. In the eyes of the Japanese, on contrary, China’s ADIZ decision is a new indicator of its coercive intention.

Resumption of the two sets of talks is a positive step. Political contacts at different levels of government may begin to warm again, and channels of political communication can accordingly re-open. Last week, a governor-level Chinese official visited Japan, another signal of political thawing. And despite its shortness, rituality, and rigidity, the Xi -Abe summit meeting in Beijing in November, confirmed the resilience of China-Japan relations. It remains quite unrealistic to assume, however, that China and Japan will firmly and explicitly improve their relations. Maritime security talks may not achieve an obvious breakthrough. There are several reasons why this is the case.

First, diplomatic pragmatism does not necessarily beget a political resolution or end Sino-Japanese maritime discord. There is no sign yet that domestic politics will permit the political leadership on one or both sides to change policy course. Instead, both capitals maintain the same tense tones they have used in the past. China just declared its decision to <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015-01/27/content_19419658.htm">conduct a military parade</a> on September 3, 2015, the 70th anniversary day of Japan’s surrendering day. Japan is not comfortable with this decision. Furthermore, Abe now is exploiting the chance of 70th anniversary to push an “Abe Statement”, implicitly purporting to modify “Murayama Statement” in 1995 which sincerely recognized Japan’s World War II atrocities and constituted official remorse. The irony is that historical tensions between Beijing and Tokyo seem untouchable, even with the resumption of talks. There is little evidence that both leaders will significantly compromise over maritime disputes without emergence of a broader political rapprochement.

Second, both sides are stalled when it comes to the issue of what should be prioritized in maritime talks. Beijing has allegedly asked for Tokyo’s acceptance of China’s ADIZ, and attempted to resolve their ADIZ conflicts first. But Tokyo seems to see no way can change its opposition to China’s East China Sea zone, and it is not clear how much progress the parties will make if they cannot negotiate on this issue.

Third, competing concerns still top China and Japan’s agendas. De-escalating their territorial conflict now extends well beyond the sovereignty claim itself and has become a matter of managing power relations in the region. The power rivalry between Beijing and Tokyo is hard to defuse, as the two sides are locked in a competition that is based on geography and taking place during a power-shift. Before their security dilemma can be eased, China and Japan will have to find ways to coexist in the maritime Asia.

Maritime security talks between China and Japan nonetheless remain meaningful and productive. The entire international community would not rather see their rivalry spiral into conflict. The return to talks allows them to shift some attention to other issues in their relationship, and resuming a working link will add to their ability to manage crises. That will conceivably benefit regional stability in East Asia and better for both countries.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[President Barack Obama’s visit to India on January 25-27, 2015 renewed India’s place as a centerpiece of the “pivot to Asia.” Moving ahead with <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/04/AR2008090401614.html">long-pending strategic deals</a> on civilian nuclear trade and defense co-development, along with the renewal of our expiring <a href="http://library.rumsfeld.com/doclib/sp/3211/2005-06-28%20New Framework for the US-India Defense Relationship.pdf">New Framework for the U.S. India Defense Relationship</a>, underscores the new cooperative spirit with which our strategic communities are engaging each other. The real gem from this visit may ultimately prove to be the <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1DbxMEx">U.S.-India Joint Strategic Vision for the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean Region</a> (JSV). The vision laid out in this document offers similar promise to the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/WCPD-2004-01-19/pdf/WCPD-2004-01-19-Pg61-2.pdf">2004 Next Steps in Strategic Partnership</a> (NSSP) in terms of its scope for transforming—and upgrading—our strategic partnership.

The JSV, like the NSSP, is not an exhaustive document with specific measures outlined in advance. In the JSV, the U.S. and India focus heavily on the countries’ shared values and the desire for security as a means to achieve prosperity. Finding tangible ways to turn the principles contained in the JSV into action is not a direct and easy path. But if our governments commit themselves to breathing life into these principles, it is a powerful step towards creating a more stable Asia.

To India, deepening strategic engagement beyond its immediate neighborhood highlights a growing recognition that its interests are fast becoming global. Engaging the U.S. on regional security issues will benefit India in important ways:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Stability in Channels of Goods Trade</strong>: Today, India’s goods trade balance is around forty percent of GDP, up from thirteen percent in 1991. India shares a land border with only one of its top twenty-five trade partners (China) so much of this trade comes from the sea, including hydrocarbons. A disruption to these trade flows will have a meaningful impact on the Indian economy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Protecting the Diaspora</strong>: India has a vast non-resident population, sometimes living in unstable areas. The Ministry of Overseas Indians lists among the top twenty-five countries by non-resident Indian population such places as Nepal, Burma, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, and Yemen. Each of these countries has faced issues of domestic or regional instability that should be of concern to India’s leaders.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Access to America’s Strategic Technologies</strong>: The U.S. generally withholds top-line strategic technologies except from our most trusted partners. Assisting in the maintenance of global stability will support the case for allowing the export of more advanced strategic technologies to India.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Ability to Influence American Foreign Policy</strong>: When the U.S. thinks of India as non-aligned or inwardly-focused, it is relatively easy to dismiss Indian suggestions for moderating America’s foreign policy. But if we deepen our strategic partnership and the U.S. finds itself relying on India to some degree, it provides new leverage for India to help influence American foreign policy.</li>
</ul>
The U.S.-India Joint Strategic Vision for the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean Region could prove a seminal document in laying out the principles for a new strategic global partnership, much like the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/WCPD-2004-01-19/pdf/WCPD-2004-01-19-Pg61-2.pdf">Next Steps in Strategic Partnership</a> did for our bilateral strategic partnership. Such documents which lack specific next steps can only be truly judged in hindsight. But having leaders committed to follow-through opens the door to interesting possibilities to advance the partnership.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>In Confidence: Will We Know if US-China CBMs Are Working?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In November 2014, the United States and China concluded two major confidence-building measures (CBMs), <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/12/remarks-president-obama-and-president-xi-jinping-joint-press-conference">which they announced at a bilateral summit</a>. The CBMs include an agreement that each side will notify the other of major military activities, and a code of conduct for safe maritime and air encounters. Where the code of conduct is concerned, the ship-to-ship component for surface vessels is complete and the two nations have pledged to complete an air-to-air annex by the end of 2015. These agreements have theoretically been in the works since Washington and Beijing established the <a href="http://fas.org/nuke/control/sea/text/us-china98.htm">Military Maritime Consultative Agreement (MMCA)</a> in 1998. The MMCA has born little fruit until now, but if these MOUs and follow-on accords are fully implemented, they could help to reduce the risk of accident between vessels and aircraft and lower the risk of inadvertent escalation between the US and China.

The goal of the agreements are broader than this, however. As with many other military-to-military agreements, The <a href="http://www.defense.gov/pubs/141112_MemorandumOfUnderstandingOnNotification.pdf">Notification of Major Military Activities Agreement</a> and <a href="http://www.defense.gov/pubs/141112_MemorandumOfUnderstandingRegardingRules.pdf">Rules of Behavior Memorandum of Understanding</a> are based on the premise that if two potential adversaries know more about one another’s military intentions, they are more likely to be able to avoid dangerous and destabilizing misperceptions. The Notification of Major Military Activities Agreement aims to encourage the parties to alert one another about major developments in security policy and strategy, and to allow for reciprocal observation at major military exercises. The Rules of Behavior MOU develops a code of conduct for ship-to-ship encounters at sea. Unlike other confidence-building agreements, however, these new MOUs for U.S.-China confidence-building have two unique features: Under their terms, notification of the other party is voluntary, and; information that parties report to one another is to be kept confidential. Taken together, these two features make it especially difficult for interested observers to know if the agreements are, in fact, being implemented.

Under both the Notification of Major Military Activities and Rules of Behavior MOUs, participation and implementation by the United States and China is voluntary and non-binding. The code of conduct agreement relies heavily on existing multilateral agreements, namely the <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/International_Regulations_for_Preventing_Collisions_at_Sea">COLREGs agreement</a>, which is considered binding, and the <a href="http://www.cpf.navy.mil/news.aspx/010254">Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea</a> agreement developed by the Western Pacific Naval Symposium. The United States preferred to apply existing international agreements to the U.S.-China bilateral relationship, rather than sign a new, compulsory agreement. More broadly, this may reflect the fact that the U.S.-China military relationship is still embryonic, and the parties may have been wary of the implications of compulsory notification, observation, and rules of behavior. When two parties are attempting to foster cooperation between them, however, one important feature is reciprocity—the exchange of mutually beneficial actions. Even if an agreement is voluntarily, the two sides can still choose to engage in reciprocity, but the nonbinding character of these accords means that reciprocity is not guaranteed and cannot be assumed.

The agreements also state that assessments that the United States and China conduct under the MOUs are to be kept confidential, and neither side is to make disclosures to any third party without written permission from the other. The recent CBM agreements allow the US and China to provide written summaries of their proceedings to third parties and for public release, but the confidentiality provision means that outside observers will not be able to observe the degree to which the MOUs are being implemented. Indeed, the U.S. Department of Defense and PRC’s Ministry of National Defense are the two agencies authorized to implement the memoranda, so it seems that other agencies within each government may not receive detailed assessments of progress unless the other side authorizes interagency information sharing.

Presumably, the U.S. and China opted for voluntary and confidential notification measures because these features made it easier for both sides to reach an agreement on CBMs in the first place. Binding agreements would obviously have been more restrictive, and non-confidential accords would have been inconsistent with the original MMCA and would also have subjected the states’ military activities to greater public scrutiny. Without confidentiality, both sides may have feared that the other would use assessments to score political points on the global stage.

Other agreements with similar aims, however, such as the <a href="http://www.state.gov/t/isn/4791.htm#treaty">1972 US-Soviet Incidents at Sea Agreement</a>, do not contain these provisions, and the voluntary and confidential nature of the U.S.-China MOUs combine with curious effect. Because the MOUs are not compulsory, observers cannot assume that either or both sides are implementing them fully, and because they are confidential, we cannot expect to receive the evidence that would allow interested observers to know whether its provisions are being followed. For those of us who are eager to track progress on U.S.-China military confidence-building, it would seem that the best available metric is a negative one: We will know that the agreements are not being implemented if one or both governments publicizes the fact that there has been a dangerous encounter between vessels or aircraft. A repeat USS Cowpens or P-8 aircraft incident will tell us that these CBMs are not progressing as intended. But if they are serving their purpose in whole or in part, we may expect to hear relatively little of them.

Ultimately, analysts’ and experts’ ability to monitor the MOUs’ implementation is of secondary importance at best: CBMs exist for the purpose of building military relationships, and if these voluntary, confidential CBMs bear fruit, then perhaps they will result in more binding and more public agreements later as the military-to-military relationship deepens.

The United States and China both want to expand the scope of the military notification agreement. The United States has pressed to include missile launches, and some PLA officers have said privately that China wants to be notified of US arms sales to Taiwan. Neither of these proposals has been acceptable to the other side, however. Additionally, the code of conduct agreement is likely to become a template for China and Japan’s East China Sea crisis mechanism, which they aim to implement by mid-2015. Whether and how these unique agreements can be expanded between the U.S. and China, and whether they will serve as a useful templates for other mil-to-mil efforts remains to be seen. Asia security watchers should remember, however, that the best sign these CBMs are working may be if we don’t hear much about them at all.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Following the first meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping in November 2014, Tokyo and Beijing have resumed official talks to turn the East China Sea into a zone of “peace, cooperation, and friendship.” On January 12, representative from each country’s defense ministry, navy, and air force met in Tokyo and reaffirmed their commitment to establishing a maritime and air communication mechanism to prevent crisis in and above the East China Sea. Also, on January 22, both countries held the Japan-China high-level consultation on maritime affairs in Yokohama, in which all the principle maritime-related organizations on both sides, including coast guards, got together for the third time.

Tokyo and Beijing essentially reached an understanding on the structure of their maritime communication mechanism in June 2012. Under the mechanism, the two defense authorities would establish hotlines, regular consultations, and common communication methods between ships for risk mitigation. <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/01/12/national/politics-diplomacy/japan-china-resume-talks-on-maritime-crisis-management-mechanism/#.VNJHTWjF98E">The January 12 meeting</a> reaffirmed this understanding and the parties agreed to seek a mechanism for communication between aircraft given the higher frequency of Japanese and Chinese air operations. It is expected that the talks will continue and be upgraded to the ministerial or vice ministerial level to implement the mechanism later this year.

Different views on freedom of navigation and overflight will continue to produce incidents or close encounters at sea and in sky even if this communication mechanism is implemented. But such a mechanism is still necessary for Japan and China to reduce misperception, increase predictability, and lower the risk of accident that could escalate given profound mutual mistrust and ongoing defense buildups by both countries.

Meanwhile, such a mechanism needs to be endorsed by a common maritime code of conduct based on the <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/International_Regulations_for_Preventing_Collisions_at_Sea">International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS)</a> and the <a href="http://news.usni.org/2014/06/17/document-conduct-unplanned-encounters-sea">Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES)</a> for risk prevention. CUES was adopted by regional navies when China hosted the Western Pacific Naval Symposium in April 2014, and the Japanese and Chinese navies should start to implement CUES when they encounter one another in the East China Sea even before the bilateral mechanism is formally implemented.

The high-level maritime consultation is also developing as an effective confidence-building measure between Tokyo and Beijing. The first meeting was held in Hangzhou in May 2012 and the second one was supposed to be held in Japan later that year. This did not occur due to the high tensions between the parties after September 2012. The second meeting was held in Qingdao in September 2014, where Tokyo and Beijing agreed to build mutual understanding on maritime affairs. At the January 22, 2015 meeting, the two countries established four working groups on policy/law of the sea, maritime defense, maritime law enforcement, and maritime economy, and also agreed to seek a dialogue between the two coast guards.

In short, there are positive signs of improvement. However, as the year 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, history may hinder overall Japan-China cooperation again. At the same time, this anniversary is an opportunity to calm down the tension over historical interpretations of imperial Japanese aggression. How Prime Minister Abe will balance history with Japan’s future role in the region will be of critical importance when he makes a statement commemorating the 70th anniversary in August.]]></content:encoded>

<h3>1. Itu Aba</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The largest land feature in the Spratly Islands, the only Spratly Island with <a href="http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/156127/">fresh ground water</a>, and the only island that Taiwan occupies in the South China Sea</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/156127/">1.3 kilometers in length</a> and less than half a square kilometer in total area</li>
	<li>Held by Taiwan since 1946, when Japan left the island at the end of the Second World War</li>
	<li>The Republic of China <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=fv5zbgaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa175&amp;lpg=pa175&amp;dq=taiwan+established+a+permanent+presence+on+itu+aba+island+in+july+1956&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nbxdo4mkpy&amp;sig=xrcl_6kvyybx0pjqt0w7xpnjx-s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=pntbvigxf4seyqsokyhqbw&amp;ved=0cc8q6aewaw#v=onepage&amp;q=taiwan%20established%20a%20permanent%20presence%20on%20itu%20aba%20island%20in%20July%201956&amp;f=false">established a permanent base</a> there in 1956</li>
	<li>In 2000, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=iklwawaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa37&amp;lpg=pa37&amp;dq=2000,+a+detachment+of+the+roc+coast+guard+administration+was+stationed+on+itu+aba&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e3x2ntxy-e&amp;sig=s3b2vr6rf7_7ab8ga7wj6z8dy4i&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=ixtbvlvrnsx2yqsbryggdg&amp;ved=0ccsq6aewag#v=onepage&amp;q=2000%2C%20a%20detachment%20of%20the%20ROC%20Coast%20Guard%20Administration%20was%20stationed%20on%20itu%20aba&amp;f=false">Taiwan sent a Coast Guard deployment</a> of 100 personnel to the island to replace a detachment of Marines and built an airstrip in 2008</li>
	<li>Taiwan is currently in the midst of a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/25/taiwan-southchinasea-idusl3n0o70av20140525">$100 million Itu Aba port</a> renovation that will allow it to accommodate frigates and coast guard cutters</li>
	<li>It is also making improvements to its 1,200 meter runway, used mostly for C-130 cargo planes</li>
	<li>Taiwan has also reportedly considered the <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/16/uk-taiwan-soutchinasea-idukkcn0i509o20141016">permanent stationing</a> of armed vessels on Itu Aba</li>
	<li>In November 2014, Taiwan halted its Itu Aba port renovation <a href="http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=2682084">after revelations</a> that a Chinese ship and crew were involved in transport but it has since restarted</li>
	<li><a href="http://news.ltn.com.tw/news/politics/breakingnews/1234783">New reports</a> out of Taiwan indicate that the runway renovation will be complete by the end of February, 2015</li>

<h3>2. Gaven Reef</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Located in the Tizard Banks, controlled by China</li>
	<li>China has had a troop and supply garrison here as far back as 2003</li>
	<li>This has <a href="http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/06/13/14/china-reclaiming-land-5-reefs">included a large supply platform</a> where ships can dock, several gun emplacements, and radar and communications equipment</li>
	<li>Significant construction began sometime after March 30, 2014 and was <a href="http://www.janes.com/article/43757/china-builds-another-island-in-south-china-sea">confirmed in August, 2014</a></li>
	<li>The new artificial island is approximately 300 meters by 250 meters</li>
	<li>A total of 114,000 square meters of new land has been created</li>
	<li>A new building on Gaven Reef <a href="http://www.janes.com/article/48984/imagery-shows-progress-of-chinese-land-building-across-spratlys">is almost identical</a> to one on Hughes Reef, and includes a main square building with what appears to be an anti-aircraft tower</li>

<h3>3. Johnson South Reef</h3>
<ul>
	<li>7.2 square kilometer submerged reef in the Union Banks occupied by China</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.janes.com/article/43456/china-advances-with-johnson-south-reef-construction">Until early 2014</a>, the only manmade feature was a small concrete platform that housed a communications facility, garrison building, and pier</li>
	<li>The platform is now surrounded by an island with an area of 100,000 square meters</li>
	<li>There has been some speculation that Beijing may build an airstrip on Johnson South Reef, but some experts have argued that this would be too small to have a significant strategic impact</li>

<h3>4. Fiery Cross Reef</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Controlled by China, which garrisons approximately 200 troops and has radar and surveillance capabilities there</li>
	<li>Active land reclamation began in <a href="http://www.janes.com/article/46083/china-building-airstrip-capable-island-on-fiery-cross-reef">August 2014</a>, although activity around the reef commenced three months prior</li>
	<li>Between August and November, Chinese dredgers created a land mass that spans the entire existing reef and is approximately 3,000 meters long and 200-300 meters wide</li>
	<li>Photos taken by <a href="http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20141021000087&amp;cid=1101">Digital Globe</a> indicate that Chinese reclamation has increased the area of Fiery Cross Reef 11 times over, growing it from .08 square kilometers to .96 square kilometers.</li>
	<li>Fiery Cross may now be <a href="http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?cid=1101&amp;maincatid=&amp;id=20150203000066">more than three times larger</a> than Itu Aba, formerly the largest of the Spratlys</li>
	<li>Analysts believe that China may also be <a href="http://www.cimsec.org/another-unsinkable-aircraft-carrier/14349">constructing an airstrip</a> on Fiery Cross</li>
</ul>

<br />
<hr />
<br />
 
<h3>Other Spratly Projects</h3>
<p>These are some of the most notable South China Sea construction projects of the last year, but China and Taiwan are hardly the only two countries to have undertaken construction in the Spratlys. Vietnam captured Southwest Cay from the Philippines in 1975, and it has <a href="http://www.janes.com/article/39716/china-goes-all-out-with-major-island-building-project-in-spratlys">since built</a> a harbor and other facilities there. <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/141632/andrew-s-erickson-and-austin-strange/pandoras-sandbox">Malaysia engaged</a> in significant construction and reclamation at Swallow Reef after occupying it in 1983. The Philippines is <a href="http://www.ihsmaritime360.com/article/13274/china-goes-all-out-with-major-island-building-project-in-spratlys">planning to upgrade an airport and pier</a> on Thitu Island. Until its work on Fiery Cross, <a href="http://www.janes.com/article/37973/china-building-artificial-island-in-south-china-sea">China was the only major Spratlys claimant</a> without an airstrip. What sets China’s activities apart, however, is that Beijing has been dramatically changing the size and structure of physical land features, while other claimants have built upon or modified existing land masses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Much has been written and reported on China’s recent land reclamation and mass construction activities in the Paracel and Spratly Islands, which raise alarm about Chinese plans to alter the status quo in the South China Sea. Of course, Chinese and even <a href="http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20141030000057&amp;cid=1101">Taiwanese officials</a> and scholars have put forward complaints that it is unfair to point fingers at China without criticizing other claimants’ actions. It is true that all claimants, except Brunei, have engaged in different kinds of constructions on the features they control. They also share the some of the same objectives: demonstrating effective control to advance their sovereignty claims, improving the living standards of people working there, and defending these features from being attacked. It is, however, worth pointing out the difference in the nature, scale, purpose, and timing of land building and construction activities undertaken by China and other South China Sea claimants.

Unlike the situation in the Paracels, where China used force in 1974 to drive out Vietnamese troops and take over all islands, rocks, buildings, and facilities, the situation in the Spratlys can be characterized as “first come, first build.” The first wave of actual occupation took place between the Second World War and the 1970s when Vietnam, Taiwan, and the Philippines occupied the biggest islands, followed by Malaysia, which came to occupy the features that lie within its claimed continental shelf. The second wave of occupation bids began when Chinese forces wrestled control of the Johnson South Reef in 1988 after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq30CY9nWE8">killing about 70 Vietnamese sailors</a> stationed there, followed by a competition between China and Vietnam. As a result of this process, most of the features controlled by other claimants in the Spratlys are naturally formed and permanently dry islands or rocks, while seven of those features occupied by China - the latest comer to the Spratlys- are submerged reefs or low-tide elevations. This state of affairs leads to at least three differences between Chinese activities and others’ actions in the Spratlys.

First, for <a href="http://amti.csis.org/land-reclamation-a-south-china-sea-game-changer/">various reasons</a> including the desire to improve its defensive and offensive capabilities, China is reclaiming its occupied reefs (originally submerged or low-tide elevations), while other claimants simply needed to build necessary facilities on their occupied islands and rocks, without changing the geological conditions of those features. Vietnam, for example, follows a standard pattern with <a href="http://vietnam.vnanet.vn/vnp/en-us/13/105937/cover-story/peaceful-truong-sa-islands.html">constructions </a>on its controlled Spratly islands. On big islands, it sets up administrative and civilian buildings, a light house, a wind power system, a helipad, parabolic disc antennas, gun emplacements, gun shelters, military barracks, concrete bunkers, and several light posts. On small rocks it has often erected a gold-painted three-story concrete building with solar panels, parabolic disc antennas, with gun emplacements around for defensive purposes.

Second, and related, the construction projects undertaken by other claimants on their controlled rocks or islands do not seek alter the legal status of those features and are therefore permissible under international law. The massive scale of China’s land reclamation and construction seeks to change the legal status of the features, turning submerged reefs or low-tide elevations into large-scale islands or at least artificial islands. These actions are only legally allowable within a coastal state’s exclusive economic zone and continental shelf.

Third, it should be noted that other claimants had almost completed major construction undertakings on their controlled islands before signing the 2002 ASEAN-China Declaration of Conduct on the South China Sea (DOC) and have since then engaged in only minor upgrading or repair work. In contrast, while China has since 1988 also engaged in building activities on the land features it controls, its extensive reclamation and construction scheme began to take momentum simultaneously on all seven of its occupied reefs in the Spratlys in 2014.

To better understand the purpose of various land building and construction activities undertaken by different claimants in the Spratlys, one needs to view those activities in tandem with the broader strategies that each of these countries adopts in handling South China Sea issues. Since the 1990s, Vietnam and other ASEAN claimants have implicitly reached a common understanding to maintain the status quo of occupation, to settle disputes by peaceful means, and to refrain from activities that may negatively affect interests of other members. Taiwan’s activities have mainly concentrated on its occupied island Itu Aba and do not directly threaten other claimants in the South China Sea

Since 1992, when tensions with China flared up after <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/21/world/china-sends-warships-to-vietnam-oil-site.html">Beijing awarded</a> to the Crestone Energy Corporation a concession for oil exploration in the Vanguard Bank – an area that falls within Vietnam’s 200 nautical mile EEZ– the issue of defending Vietnamese sovereign rights and jurisdiction has become more pressing than its need to bolster Spratly sovereignty claims. Consequently, Vietnam has been shifting its investments from land building projects in the Spratlys to plans to improve the capacity of its naval, air, and law enforcement forces while maintaining the status quo of control and presence.

This situation also explains the contrast in interpretations of <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part8.htm">Article 121 of UNCLOS</a> on the legal regime of islands between China on one hand and Vietnam (and the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei) on the other. To narrow down the area of maritime dispute, the Southeast Asian claimants consider, explicitly or implicitly, that Spratly features are rocks and can generate maximally 12 nautical miles of territorial sea. In contrast, to maximize the area of maritime dispute, and beyond relying on its infamous U-shaped line, China has advocated that the <a href="http://www.nbr.org/publications/element.aspx?id=565">Spratly features</a> are islands and therefore fully entitled to territorial seas, EEZs and continental shelves. It has invested heavily in land reclamation and construction projects to turn its occupied features into full-fledged islands that can fulfill the requirement Article 121 of UNCLOS of being able to <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part8.htm">“sustain human habitation or economic life of their own”</a>.

It seems clear that with its strategic design, political determination, economic prowess and technological advantage, China will far outpace other claimants in land building efforts in the Spratlys. For Southeast Asian claimants, engaging in significant land building or construction works on occupied Spratly features seems to be a not-so-tempting endeavor that would undermine their interest in narrowing the area of maritime dispute and protecting the EEZs and continental shelves generated from their mainland. For China, however, the seemingly-endless thrust for land reclamation and construction may have just begun.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On February 7, 2014, Taiwan began development work on Taiping Island (Itu Aba), the largest of the Spratly archipelago, which has been under its control since 1956. It is also claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, and mainland China.

Taiwan’s development project comes in two parts and includes the construction of two new piers and improvements to the 1200-meter long runway built in 2008. The project also includes a 212 meter long access road, navigation guidance and other auxiliary facilities, rain water drainage improvement, landing light repairs, and a refueling facility. In December 2014, it was also reported that <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/12/21/2003607230">a lighthouse</a> is to be built on the island.

The Taiping development project was announced by President Ma Ying-jeou in early September 2012. The Taiwan Area National Expressway Engineering Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation is responsible for the project, which will cost NT$3.3 billion (US$ 110 million) and must be completed by the end of 2015. The watertight chambers needed for construction of the piers were completed in Taiwan's Tainan City in early November 2014. Because the contractor for the project could not find a Taiwanese ship able to transport the caissons, it turned to Shanghai Zhenhua Port Machinery Company, a Chinese state-run company, for help. The plan to use the company’s vessel Zhenhua 7 worried some Taiwanese legislators, in particular those who from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) due to national security concerns.

<em>Zhenhua</em> 7 is a flag-of-convenience (FOC) ship and is registered in Libya. Because the vessel is owned by a Chinese state-run company, with Chinese crew members, however, it also raised questions concerning interpretation and application of Taiwan’s Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area. Under the Act, no Chinese vessels may enter restricted or prohibited waters in Taiwan’s territory unless permitted by the relevant authorities. The prohibited waters are 4,000 meters seaward measured from Taiping Island’s coast and the restricted waters are 6,000 meters from the coast.

The development work at Taiping Island was <a href="http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=2682084">brought to a halt</a> between November, 2014, and first half of January, 2015, because of these national security concerns. After consultations between the concerned legislators and the government agencies, permission was given for the <em>Zhenhua</em> 7 to complete its transport, but with a number of attached conditions, including inspection on board and monitoring by Taiwan’s Coast Guard vessels during the entire shipping process. The vessel arrived at Taiping Island on January 25. After unloading the caissons, it left on January 28. Taiwan’s development work on Taiping Island and the use of a mainland Chinese vessel raise a number of important questions that are relevant to Washington-Taipei-Beijing relations in the South China Sea.

First, it is Taiwan’s official position that Taipei will not cooperate with Beijing in the South China Sea. The main reason for this is that Taiwan is concerned about the security threat from mainland China and it has close security ties with the United States. In recent years, however, Beijing has stepped up its call for Cross-Strait cooperation on the South China Sea. Mainland China repeatedly reminds Taiwan that the islands and maritime rights in the South China Sea are property handed down from ancestors (<em>zǔ chǎn</em>) and therefore it is a common obligation for the two sides to safeguard sovereignty (<em>zhǔ quán</em>) and promote overall Chinese interests in the South China Sea. This helps explain why Beijing tolerated President Chen Shui-ban’s move to build a runway on Taiping Island in 2007 and 2008, despite its distaste for Chen’s pro-independence policies.

Taiwan’s territorial claims in the South China Sea are identical to mainland China’s. Taiwan’s U-shaped line is also similar, if not exactly the same, to Beijing’s nine-dash line. But Taiwan’s concern about its security ties with the United States, and Washington’s worry about Taipei’s possible cooperation with Beijing on South China Sea issues have forced Taipei to adopt an independent approach to safeguard sovereignty and maritime rights without seeking cooperation with Beijing. This approach is known as <em>xiōnɡ dì dēnɡ shān gèzì nǔ lì</em> (two brothers climb a mountain, each one is on his own).

Taiwan’s use of the <em>Zenhua</em> 7 vessel raises questions about this approach. Should we add <em>dàn àn zhōnɡ bānɡ mánɡ</em> (but assist secretly) to <em>xiōnɡ dì dēnɡ shān gèzì nǔ lì</em>? Did mainland China indeed help Taiwan in this shipping matter? Should Taiwan expect more help from the mainland or other types of under-the-table functional cooperation? This could include China allowing Taiwan to join the maritime cooperation project between the mainland and ASEAN countries, or signing a cross-Strait fisheries agreement in the South China Sea. It should be noted that on January 19, 2015, Taiwan and mainland China agreed to a joint study project on further cross-Strait economic cooperation and Taipei’s participation in the Asian regional economic integration process, in particular TPP and RCEP. Beijing also welcomes Taiwan’s participation in the so-called “<a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/11/chinas-marshall-plan-is-much-more/">One Belt and One Road</a>” development process.

If Taiwan wants to avoid seeking help from Beijing, should it turn to the United States, the Philippines, Vietnam, or perhaps Singapore for the vessels that it needs, assuming this option is timely and makes economic sense? Would Taiwan be able to obtain such help in support of its development work on Taiping Island?

From Beijing’s perspective, allowing its vessel to transport caissons to Taiping Island not only helps Taiwan, but mainland China. Beijing may need to build its own piers on the islands it occupies in the Spratly Islands. <em>Zenhua</em> 7’s shipping experience may be useful as mainland China makes all-out efforts to develop the islands that it occupies in the Spratlys.

In addition, it can be argued that Taipei is assisting Beijing because mainland China considers Taiwan to be a part of China and the runway or piers built on Taiping Island may be used by mainland China in the future after reunification of the two sides. Beijing sees Taiwan’s development work on Taiping Island as a long-term strategic asset. Alternatively, if Taiwan moved towards independence, it is possible that mainland China would take Taiping Island by force. Given that Beijing is building runways and other military-related facilities on the land features it occupies near Taiping Island, including Fiery Cross Reef, Johnson Reef, and Cuarteron Reef, this Chinese calculus cannot be overlooked. Certainly it poses a serious security threat to Taiwan.

Finally, the construction of piers and reinforced runways are also useful to support Taiping’s legal status as an island that generates a 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and continental shelf in accordance with Article 121 of UNCLOS. This is, in turn, relevant to the ongoing legal arbitration between Manila and Beijing. The existing runway and new piers to be built will certainly support this legal status. Since Beijing considers Taiwan a part of China, the Philippines accepts the “One China” principle in its foreign relations with mainland China, and Taiping Island is now controlled by Taiwan, it is not difficult to understand why Beijing would want to help Taiwan and why Taiwan accepted that assistance.

While other claimants in the Spratly Islands, including Vietnam, the Philippines, and mainland China, are endeavoring to expand their holdings and strengthen their control over the disputed islands that are also claimed by Taiwan, Taipei needs to take more actions so that it can remain a player in the South China Sea power game. As Taiwan’s perception of security threat from Vietnam, the Philippines, and other claimants in the area increases, Taipei has to take actions to enhance its defensive capacity on Taiping Island and to speed up its work on the island.

Taiwan has repeatedly made it clear to the countries concerned that the ROC should not be excluded from conversations about the South China Sea, including those that aim to develop a Code of Conduct. Without Beijing’s support, it seems unlikely that Taiwan will be involved in this regional security dialogue process. Likewise, Taiwan needs Beijing’s support to participate in regional economic development projects led by mainland China. Finally, as Taiwan cannot participate in the arbitral proceedings that were initiated by the Philippines in January 2013, Taipei also need to prepare an international response, because the arbitration case touches upon Taiwan’s core national interest, including the U-shaped line and sovereignty claims to the islands and waters in the South China Sea.

Where U.S.-Taiwan ties are concerned, Taipei’s development work on Taiping Island will probably increase Washington’s attention and may help to strengthen military and security cooperation with Taiwan in the South China Sea. This explains why the United States has issued no official statements asking Taiwan to stop its development work on Taiping Island.

Some additional developments will also affect Washington-Taipei-Beijing relations in the South China Sea. First, Taiwan’s presidential election is to begin next month when the DPP selects its candidate. The KMT will do the same in May. Second, it can be expected that the arbitral tribunal will hold public hearings on the arbitration case between Manila and Beijing this coming summer. Third, a series of security dialogue meetings organized by ASEAN under the chairmanship of Malaysia will take place in July and October 2015. Accordingly, Taiwan’s development work on Taiping Island will have important policy implications for Washington-Taipei-Beijing relations as these events unfold.

As President Ma considers how he might apply the East China Sea Peace Initiative to help manage disputes in the South China Sea, his visit and remarks made at the inauguration ceremony on Taiping Island for the <a href="http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201410060007.aspx">new piers</a> should be considered good moves, which might help the KMT in Taiwan’s 2016 president election. But will this development help maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea? Time will tell.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Legal Challenge of China’s Island Building</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Those closely following the situation in the South China Sea have been wringing their hands about the military potential of China’s unprecedented island building work over the last year. This anxiety is understandable, and the expanded patrol and surveillance capacity that Beijing is constructing with facilities, docks, and probably at least one airstrip in the Spratly Islands will complicate the disputes in the South China Sea. But fellow claimant states and outside governments also need to recognize the damaging effects this island-building campaign will have on the legal prospects of reaching an equitable solution to the disputes.

In June 2014, the Philippine government released photographs indicating Chinese efforts to expand, via dredging sand from the seafloor, five reefs that China occupies in the Spratly Islands: Cuarteron, Eldad, Gaven, Hughes, and Johnson. Since then, evidence has emerged of Chinese reclamation work at Fiery Cross Reef, which now appears capable of housing a small airstrip—just the fourth in the island group—and most recently at Mischief Reef. Most of these expansion efforts have since been confirmed by imagery from consulting firm IHS Jane’s and on-the-ground reporting by the BBC.

Of the features China is expanding, three—Gaven, Hughes, and Mischief—are among those the Philippines has asked a tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague to declare low-tide elevations. Another three—Cuarteron, Fiery Cross, and Johnson—are in the list of features Manila has asked the court to declare legally rocks, not islands. These definitions matter immensely in any attempt to reach a long-term system to manage the disputes in the Spratlys because they determine the maritime entitlements each feature generates.

A low-tide elevation creates no territorial sea, exclusive economic zone (EEZ), or continental shelf, and cannot be claimed as territory in its own right. It is legally part of the seabed and its only real effect on the maritime regime is that, if it lies within the 12 nautical mile territorial sea of another feature, it can be considered the baseline from which that rock or island’s entitlements are measured. A rock, which is distinguished from an island by not being able to sustain independent human habitation or economic life, generates a territorial sea but no EEZ or continental shelf.

A low-tide elevation cannot be made into a rock or island—the relevant article of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea is explicit that the latter two must be “naturally formed” above water at high-tide. And while no court has yet ruled on the matter, there is broad consensus among legal experts that a rock cannot be made into an island. What matters is the original status of the feature, not what it is made into.

Determining the original status of a feature, especially in the Spratly Islands, is more difficult than might be expected. The 2012 International Court of Justice ruling on a dispute between Colombia and Nicaragua, which included a number of low-lying reefs and islets, underscored the high bar set for proving the status of features. Satellite imagery, or even aerial photography, are unlikely to be acceptable to a court except in the most obvious cases. Instead, judges will require rigorous geological surveys of features, preferably conducted during the highest tide of the year (the perigean spring tide, often called a “king tide”).

Accurate surveys in the South China Sea are notoriously lacking, and will prove impossible for features permanently modified by Chinese expansion. To be fair, Beijing is not the only claimant to perform reclamation work, but there is a qualitative difference between building new islands and preventing the erosion of existing ones (such as Vietnam has done at Spratly Island). The best hope for a long-term system to manage the disputes around the Spratlys requires agreeing to an area of legally disputed water and seabed (the disputes over the actual islands are irreconcilable for the foreseeable future) in which claimants can cooperate. That will require agreement on the status of features and their entitlements, either via negotiation or arbitration.

China’s reclamation work could make such agreement by negotiation significantly more difficult, and could make arbitration all but impossible. Claimants, and interested parties including the United States, should wake up to this danger and seek to head it off before any further damage is done. A joint survey of the Spratlys, performed by the Philippines and Vietnam, preferably with Brunei and Malaysia, and assisted by outside partners, should be launched this year. It is an endeavor that will prove useful to all claimants and which, as a cooperative scientific effort, should not be seen as escalating the disputes.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As if they were not complicated enough, the South China Sea disputes took a new turn in 2014 when China began massive land reclamation work in the region. The Philippines <a href="http://www.dfa.gov.ph/index.php/newsroom/dfa-releases/2871-china-s-reclamation-on-mabini-reef">released photographs</a> showing an unprecedented transformation of formerly pristine and submerged Johnson South Reef into high and dry white sand swarming with construction activity. Satellite photographs and ship tracking data by Jane’s confirmed that China’s reclamation activities extended to <a href="http://www.janes.com/article/39716/china-goes-all-out-with-major-island-building-project-in-spratlys">other features</a>. By the end of the year, brand-new islands stood on Cuarteron, Fiery Cross, Gaven, Johnson South, and McKennan Reefs despite Philippine protests. Analysts believe Fiery Cross will be the first to host <a href="http://www.janes.com/article/46083/china-building-airstrip-capable-island-on-fiery-cross-reef">an airstrip and harbor</a>. Most recently, Manila filed <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/02/06/uk-philippines-southchinasea-idUKKBN0LA1AE20150206">another protest</a> over reported reclamation in Mischief Reef, located just 130 nm from the island province of Palawan. China has dismissed Philippine protests and sympathetic international reactions, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-29139125">initially describing</a> the activities as intended for “improving the living and working conditions of those stationed on the islands,” arguing that the reclamation fell “<a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/t1189470.shtml">within China’s sovereignty and are totally justifiable</a>.”

There is little doubt that the China’s <a href="http://www.janes.com/article/39716/china-goes-all-out-with-major-island-building-project-in-spratlys">reclamation activities</a> in the South China Sea are among its direct responses to the legal challenge launched by Manila. While the legal status of the contested features as described and presented in the arbitration case are not affected, their physical alteration effectively “tampers with the evidence”: the existence of the new islands will now cast doubt on whether the features were originally mere low-tide elevations or rocks above water at high tide. This makes future agreement over their nature and effect on delimitations even more difficult to reach.

For China, the artificial islands also address its own perceptions of weakness in the strategic situation at sea and appear to be attempts to guarantee itself against an adverse ruling. It aims to re-capture the high ground and pressure littoral states in the region to recognize that Beijing’s claims cannot be easily dismissed nor its interests denied.

There is no special rule in international law that specifically prohibits any state from undertaking reclamation at sea; as with any other maritime activity, its legitimacy must principally be reckoned from its location vis-à-vis adjacent land territory. While it is undoubtedly within a state’s sovereignty to reclaim land within the 12 nautical mile territorial sea, beyond that, it must be considered whether it falls within the relevant rights and jurisdictions of states expressly recognized in UNCLOS. From 12 to 200 nautical miles, insofar as reclamation is part of the establishment and use of artificial islands, installations, and structures (stationary oil rigs may be considered as artificial islands), it is governed by UNCLOS articles on the <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part5.htm">Exclusive Economic Zone</a> and <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part6.htm">continental shelf</a>.

Within these areas, coastal states may undertake reclamation as long as they give due notice and give due regard to the rights of all other States (UNCLOS Art. 60.3, 56.2, and 56.3). Such artificial islands, however, are clearly not entitled to maritime zones other than a 500 meter safety zone (Art. 60.5 and 60.8), and they cannot be established where they may interfere with international navigation (Art. 60.7). In the high seas beyond 200 nautical miles, all states have the freedom to establish artificial islands, installations and structures, and may not be expressly restricted by UNCLOS from reclamation activities in this respect.

To a large extent, China takes advantage of loopholes in the Philippines’ legal position. This is on account of the latter’s implicit assumption that all islands are individually entitled to only 12 nautical mile territorial seas, leaving only Palawan’s 200 nautical mile EEZ and continental shelf to reckon with in determining legal rights over Chinese-occupied features. It also exploits Manila’s concession that <a href="http://www.dfa.gov.ph/index.php/component/docman/doc_download/56-notification-and-statement-of-claim-on-west-philippine-sea?Itemid=546">some of the Chinese positions are entitled</a> at least to 12 nautical mile territorial sea zones.

<strong>Figure 1. China’s occupied features in the Spratly Islands region, including Itu Aba under Taiwan's control, in relation to the Philippine island of Palawan.</strong>

Based on these premises, Cuarteron, <a href="http://origin.www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/Staff%20Report_China%27s First Airstrip in the Spratly Islands Likely at Fiery Cross Reef_12 18 14.pdf">Fiery Cross</a>, and Gaven Reefs are located in the high seas outside the Philippine 200 nautical mile zone (in the absence of an extended continental shelf claim), making it difficult to assert that any exclusive rights are adversely affected. Johnson South and Kennan Reefs are within 200 nautical miles, but possibly located within 12 nautical miles of adjacent islands or rocks under Vietnamese possession; the determination of their legality will require at least prior detailed surveys and delimitation of maritime zones with Vietnam. Only <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/06/philippines-southchinasea-idUSL4N0VG5O320150206">Mischief Reef</a> stands alone far enough away from any other features above water and well within 200 nautical miles from Palawan, such that reclamation thereon could be subject to a proper legal determination. However, this may require a separate case altogether, since the reported reclamation began after the pending case was initiated.

Apart from the limitations of the Philippine case as formulated, China is also relying on its trump card in the dispute: the status and potential maritime zones of Itu Aba, held by Taiwan. If Itu Aba were to generate a full 200 nautical mile EEZ (unlikely though it may be), the median line between it and Palawan would encompass all of the Chinese-occupied features including Mischief Reef. This clearly requires maritime delimitation which is outside the scope of the arbitration case.

These do not necessarily lead to the conclusion that China’s reclamation activities are beyond legal reproach. Even if China’s position were hypothetically accepted, it is still bound by the notice and due regard obligations in favor of other states noted above especially in the case of artificial islands, and is additionally obligated to refrain from acting in a manner that would jeopardize or hamper a final agreement resolving the dispute (Art. 74.3 and 83.3). This includes the <a href="http://www.pca-cpa.org/showfile.asp?fil_id=664">obligation to not act unilaterally</a> in a manner that will cause permanent damage to the marine environment, or to affect the rights of the other party in a permanent manner.

Considering the nature and impact of reclamation activities on coral reefs, China is also generally obliged under international environmental law and <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/135/15877.pdf">jurisprudence </a>to give notice, undertake environmental impact assessments, and prevent or minimize significant trans-boundary environmental harm particularly in the context of shared resources. These general obligations apply even in cases where the activities and areas involved are within undisputed State territories. Notably, they may be invoked not only by the Philippines, but any one or all of the other littoral States whose coastal populations depend on the South China Sea.

Finally, even though it may be argued that all other littoral States have undertaken their own reclamation activities in the past, none have done so recently and in so massive a scale and on fully submerged reef areas, in the same manner as that being done by China. Such action clearly contravenes the spirit and commitments under the <a href="http://www.asean.org/asean/external-relations/china/item/declaration-on-the-conduct-of-parties-in-the-south-china-sea">2002 Declaration of Conduct of Parties</a> that China has repeatedly invoked.

Thus, the legitimacy of China’s latest activities must be considered not in terms of reclamation per se, but in the context of the pre-existing dispute. By these standards, China’s actions contravene higher standards of fairness and due regard for the rights of other states; these international obligations govern the conduct of states pending the resolution of their maritime disputes. These abstract legalities also have long-term geopolitical impacts.

While China may regain the strategic high ground in the near-term with its rapid reclamation, ultimately it will lose the ability to handle the disputes in the way it prefers. Any remaining trust and confidence not only of the Philippines but all other littoral States will erode, alienating its immediate maritime neighborhood and reducing the chances of equitable bilateral settlements in the future. It will also catch the closer attention of other states formerly content with staying aloof or sitting on the sidelines, giving them more reason to strengthen their political, economic, even military bonds with the smaller states. And the fact that the new islands also have significant security implications for international navigation only highlights the shared interests of the international community at large, and therefore draws the focused attention of all external maritime powers. The stakes are not only higher, but also more diverse.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On February 26, the semi-official China Military Online reported that Beijing is conducting “large-scale” land reclamation in the disputed Spratly Islands—activities that the <a href="http://amti.csis.org/">Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative</a> and major news outlets worldwide have been watching closely in recent weeks. In a follow-on article, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/26/us-china-southchinasea-idUSKBN0LU11S20150226">Reuters </a>called this public acknowledgment of work on six reefs “unusual.” We should not be terribly surprised, however, that Beijing has owned up to its rapid-fire development efforts in the South China Sea. Plenty of evidence suggests that China sees itself as catching up to other Spratly claimants and views these land features as its sovereign territory. This means that it can publicly acknowledge these efforts as a point of pride, despite the fact that other states in the region see them as deeply destabilizing.

Of the six countries (China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei) that claim territory in the Spratly Islands, <a href="http://amti.csis.org/construction-in-the-south-china-sea-a-comparative-view/">China was the last to arrive</a>. Taiwan occupied its first island in 1946 and built a base there a decade later. Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia all staked out Spratly features from the 1970s onwards, and these states claimed the more desirable features (islands and rocks). China took its first outpost there, Johnson South Reef, in 1988, after a battle <a href="http://amti.csis.org/timeline/#59">that left 70 Vietnamese soldiers dead</a>. It then occupied several more reefs for a total of seven. In the intervening years, <a href="http://amti.csis.org/before-and-after-the-south-china-sea-transformed/">Malaysia and Vietnam</a> have both reclaimed land in the Spratlys, although the details of this construction are sketchy at best in both cases. Vietnam, the Philippines, and Taiwan all have airstrips in the Spratlys, whereas China appears to be building its first one now on Fiery Cross Reef. This history matters a great deal, because what Washington and its friends and allies may see as punctuated, lightening-speed construction is likely viewed in China as a perfectly legitimate <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21645268-unprecedented-building-boom-reclamation-marks">game of catch-up</a>. Some <a href="https://southseaconversations.wordpress.com/2015/02/25/whats-not-in-the-latest-photos-of-chinas-spratly-island-construction/">international analysts</a> seem to agree with this interpretation.

A second reason that we should not be surprised by Beijing’s acknowledgement is that China sees these land features as its own territory, and therefore perfectly well within its right to reclaim and develop. Although Beijing has never clarified the precise meaning of its <a href="http://amti.csis.org/atlas/#9dash">Nine-Dash Line</a> that encompasses most of the South China Sea, we do know that it claims at least the land features as sovereign. When US officials publicly criticized China’s reclamation in November, a <a href="http://www.munsif.tv/articles/2014/11/24/china-dismisses-us-comments-land-reclamation-scs">Foreign Ministry spokesperson</a> reaffirmed Beijing’s sovereignty over the Spratlys and rejected Washington’s right to intervene. This week, rather than deny its systematic building activities, Chinese publications have announced them with pride, and hailed the news of these developments as “<a href="http://tuku.military.china.com/military/html/2015-02-24/229306_2605613.htm">Good News for the New Year</a>!” Furthermore, in just the last few days, <a href="http://slide.mil.news.sina.com.cn/h/slide_8_31042_34343.html#p=1">Chinese </a>and<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/rest-of-world/2015/02/22/what-is-china-building-in-the-south-china-sea/"> international sources</a> have announced that Beijing is building on Subi Reef—a seventh feature that was not included on last week’s list. Despite this week’s international scrutiny of China’s Spratly spree Beijing has not shied from adding another location to its reclamation manifest.

<a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Subi.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2852" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Subi-1024x654.jpg" alt="Subi" width="640" height="409" />
</a><strong>Subi Reef. November 15, 2014.</strong>

Third, when considering Beijing’s acknowledgement, recall that land reclamation <a href="http://amti.csis.org/reclamation-in-the-south-china-sea-legal-loopholes-practical-impacts/">is not illegal</a>. It violates the spirit of the 2002 China-ASEAN Declaration on Conduct for the South China Sea and certainly does not improve the chances that China and ASEAN will achieve a binding Code of Conduct, but there is no explicit legal provision against it. Indeed, China's Defense Ministry spokesman <a href="http://english.chinamil.com.cn/news-channels/china-military-news/2015-01/29/content_6332211.htm">has defended</a> reclamation against foreign criticism with the claim that it is legitimate under international law.

Beijing’s public acknowledgement, unsurprising though it may be, does underscore why the international community has relatively few responses at its disposal to directly engage Beijing’s reclamation. If China truly sees itself as rectifying its longstanding disadvantages in the Spratlys and doing so on Chinese territory without violating international law, simply shedding light on these activities will not alone be enough to dissuade further action.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Cobra Gold, the weeks-long multinational military exercise that began on Feb. 9 in Thailand, highlighted the difficult balancing act facing Washington as it engages with the military-backed government of its long-time ally.

The annual training exercise, the largest in the Asia-Pacific, has evolved in recent years into a marquee event for both the U.S.-Thai alliance and Washington's larger engagement in Asia. Given its importance, U.S. policymakers have been clear since last October that Cobra Gold would continue in 2015, but would be scaled back -- certain exercises were removed and a smaller U.S. contingent took part. Instead, the focus would rest on more noncombat training to express Washington's objection to the military government in Bangkok.

Since that announcement, U.S. and Thai officials have engaged in a low-level public relations war over the exercises and their scope. The Americans said that the exercises were cut back amid concerns over Thailand's May 2014 coup d'etat. Bangkok has insisted that any event changes were minor and not related to the coup. Sniping worsened in the weeks before Cobra Gold, fueled by the Thai authorities' anger over comments made by Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel.

Speaking at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University in late January, Russel, who heads the State department's East Asia and Pacific Affairs bureau, was critical of the junta's indefinite reliance on martial law and refusal to specify a timetable for returning the country to democracy. Nevertheless, the comments were consistent with U.S. policy since then-army commander General Prayuth Chan-ocha led the May 22 military coup last year.

But the U.S. remarks, and the furious reaction by Thai authorities, underscored the difficulties the U.S. faces in trying to remain both critical of and engaged with Bangkok, and why that engagement has appeared confused at times. In the wake of the military coup, the U.S. pulled out of an ongoing joint exercise with the Thai military, cancelled $3.5 million in military aid, and limited official visits. Yet engagement in other areas has continued.

<strong>Hijacking the narrative</strong>

In the last few weeks, Bangkok seems to have succeeded in hijacking the narrative surrounding Cobra Gold and bilateral relations. U.S. authorities have been hesitant to clarify changes made to the exercises. They have also been unable, or unwilling, to counter the insistence of Thai authorities that the exercises prove that all is well in the U.S.-Thai relationship, or claims from the human rights lobby that Washington is pushing aside their concerns and embracing the junta.

Both narratives are false. The U.S. had little choice but to limit the live-fire maneuvers at Cobra Gold and cut the numbers of troops participating. The field exercises would give prestige to the Thai military; the reduction in head count was the clearest way for the U.S. to express disapproval of continued military rule. And in the long-run, such exercises would be less important for building relationships among U.S. security partners than staff training at the annual event, in which many more countries take part.

Coup or not, Thailand is too important to U.S. Asian policy for Washington to risk alienating the nation in the long-term. The kingdom is a major non-NATO ally, providing critical military access and assistance for U.S. forces. Thailand is also America's oldest partner in the region. As a political and economic heavyweight in Southeast Asia, it is key in the Obama administration's "pivot" or "rebalance" toward Asia. Despite anxieties among regional governments about possible diversion of the U.S. focus toward the Middle East and Ukraine, the administration maintains that its long-term strategic interests rest in Asia. That assertion was given credence by the recent U.S. National Security Strategy, which reiterates a long-term commitment to economic and security engagement in Asia. The request to increase assets for the region in the president's 2016 budget proposal was a further sign of continuing commitment.

<strong>The China syndrome</strong>

Another very genuine concern that has kept U.S. leaders from alienating Thailand with additional sanctions is the growing likelihood that China could swoop in and eat Washington's lunch. U.S. policymakers should not overemphasize the China threat, although the China factor has been a useful "bogeyman" for some in Washington to wheel out in arguments to increase involvement in Asia.

Chinese engagement with the Thai military has grown rapidly in recent years, particularly since the coup, with recent high-level visits on both sides. But Sino-Thai relations remain far from the scope and quality of the U.S.-Thai security engagement. That was evident during the recent weeklong visit to Bangkok by China's defense minister Chang Wanquan. The meeting was heavy on symbolism, and carried an implicit rebuke of U.S. policy to keep Thailand's junta at arms-length. Even so, the visit, mainly appeared to produce vague commitments to step up bilateral military cooperation and repeated previously announced initiatives, such as an agreement to hold joint air force exercises.

As much as U.S. policymakers remain committed to maintaining a long friendship with Thailand, the Obama administration correctly believes that showing strong and consistent support for democracy is critical in a region that is struggling to turn toward democracy. After turning a blind eye to the military coup in Egypt, and provoking strong criticism at home and abroad, the administration could not rationalize the calm acceptance of a military takeover in a more democratically inclined ally -- Thailand -- without censure. That was perceived by Thai elites as a double standard, fueling resentment.
Washington is right to maintain engagement with both the Thai military and the populace. The relationship is too important to stagnate or fail. The U.S. has also been correct to publicly criticize and impose minor sanctions. There is wide consensus among independent analysts that the junta's plans to remake Thailand as a pseudo-democracy will fail.

The U.S. government has not sold its message well in Thailand, or back home. The narrative in Bangkok is that Washington is arrogant and uses different standards for different nations. In Washington, some say that the administration is coddling a military junta and neglecting human rights issues due to realpolitik concerns. Neither is accurate. The decision to scale down -- rather than cancel -- Cobra Gold highlights Washington's post-coup policy dilemma: demonstrating commitment to Thailand and its centrality in U.S. engagement with Asia, while signaling displeasure with the junta. That strategy cannot succeed if the prevailing narratives in Bangkok and Washington do not reflect those nuances.

To date, U.S. officials have prioritized caution over clarity in discussing U.S. engagement with Thailand, preferring to avoid details rather than risk alienating Thais or creating misunderstandings. The confusion surrounding Cobra Gold, and the false narratives it has created, highlight the shortcomings of that strategy. Overall, the U.S. has struck a good balance in its engagement with the Thai junta, but it must be more explicit in explaining its strategy and the reasoning behind it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The first week of March marks the start of <a href="http://www.usfk.mil/usfk/press-release.cfc.announces.start.of.key.resolve.2015.1260">Key Resolve</a> and <a href="http://www.usfk.mil/usfk/press-release.cfc.announces.start.of.foal.eagle.2015.1261">Foal Eagle</a>, which – together with Ulchi Freedom Guardian in the late summer – are the largest U.S.-Republic of Korea (ROK) military exercises held in South Korea each year. They consist of two separate drills, with Key Resolve lasting around one week and involving drills at the command level and Foal Eagle lasting around two months and involving field-training exercises that combine air, land, and sea elements. The exercises have been conducted since 2002 in their current <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/rsoi-foal-eagle-2002.htm">tandem form</a>. In recent years they have involved a combined total of around 12,500 U.S. troops and more than 200,000 South Korean troops, with significantly more participating in Foal Eagle than Key Resolve.

Spring exercise season each year brings some fairly predictable behavior, prompting the baseline of U.S. and ROK tensions with North Korea to increase a few notches for the duration of the drills – like the peninsula’s version of groundhog’s day. Year after year, the U.S. emphasizes the routine, defensive nature of the exercises and stresses that they are not related to “current situations” on the peninsula or elsewhere in the world. In turn, North Korea, year after year, equates the exercises to war preparations for which it will retaliate (using different variants of more colorful language) and makes every effort to link the exercises to other issues.

This year, so far, has been no exception. In January, North Korea offered to suspend nuclear tests in exchange for halting the drills. The U.S. promptly rejected this offer as a “<a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2015/02/485_173053.html">non-starter</a>.” Pyongyang also attempted to establish the cancellation of the exercises as a precondition for inter-Korean talks, which South Korean President Park Geun-hye has urged in recent months as part of her broader policy to lay the groundwork for unification. Seoul dismissed this proposal, noting that “such issues need to be discussed at <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2015/01/116_172425.html">inter-Korean talks</a>.” More recently, North Korea conducted <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/09/world/asia/north-korea-launches-5-short-range-missiles.html?_r=0">short-range missile tests</a> and an island attack and seizure <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-kim-guides-military-drill-near-sea-border-with-south-korea-2015-2">simulation</a> near Yeonpyeong-do – the South Korean island in the Yellow Sea that North Korea shelled in 2010. These sorts of North Korean actions, while far from friendly, are not out of the ordinary for spring exercise season, which regularly involves Pyongyang’s own attempts to demonstrate capabilities alongside the US-ROK exercises.

What to make of this cyclical posturing from both sides? Do these exercises – and the accompanying platform they provide for each side to dig in their heels on the issues of the day – merely play in repeat mode year after year? In short: no. A brief review of spring exercise season over the past two years reveals the extent to which these drills, despite the routine nature of basic playbooks, can be fairly consequential in either heightening hostility levels on the peninsula or scaling them down. In 2013, the exercises began in the midst of pitched tensions following North Korea’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/world/asia/north-korea-warns-of-pre-emptive-nuclear-attack.html?pagewanted=all">third nuclear test</a>. Pyongyang turned up the heat further in the early days of the drills, going beyond its usual rhetoric by declaring the 1953 Korean War armistice <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/world/asia/north-korea-says-it-has-nullified-1953-korean-war-armistice.html">nullified</a> and threatening a nuclear attack on the U.S. mainland. The U.S. countered with its own unambiguous escalatory signal: incorporating F-22 stealth fighter jets, B-2 stealth bombers, and B-52 bombers <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/04/what-is-foal-eagle/">into the drills</a>. Overall tensions remained higher than usual for a number of months, a period that U.S. officials referred to as the most dangerous <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/korea/north-korea-s-apparent-willingness-to-talk-raises-questions-1.324149">since the Korean War</a>.

The 2014 exercises, in contrast, began on the heels of the highest-level inter-Korean government meeting since President Park entered office and involved signaling of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/world/asia/korea.html?_r=0">opposite nature</a>. During the first week of the drills, North Korea made the somewhat unexpected move of allowing reunions for family members separated since the Korean War <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/24/south-korea-military-drills-us-north-korea">to proceed</a> (following threats to cancel them because of the exercises). President Park followed up with an announcement, also in the midst of the drills, that South Korea would work with Russia to develop rail and maritime links <a href="http://www.janes.com/article/34679/joint-us-south-korean-military-exercises-unlikely-to-lead-to-escalation-in-war-risk">between Russia, North and South Korea</a>. The U.S. also downscaled the military hardware involved in the exercises, excluding aircraft carriers and nuclear-capable <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/2014/0206/US-South-Korea-joint-military-exercises-three-things-you-need-to-know">strategic bombers</a>.

What might we expect in 2015? Looking back only two years and given the volatile nature of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, it is difficult to make any definitive predictions. Yet the 2013 and 2014 spring exercise seasons suggest two takeaways that might help in assessing this year’s drills. First, the way in which the exercises are handled plays a role in managing broader tensions. The U.S. has not cancelled the exercises in response to North Korean requests since the 1990s. But it has used more subtle signals – scaling down drills in 2014, for instance, or minimizing their publicity – to indicate openness to more cooperative relations.

Second, the atmospherics surrounding the exercises tend to reflect pre-existing moods in inter-Korean and U.S.-North Korea relations. This year brings a mixed bag. The two Koreas appear to be moving, in fits and starts, toward a new set of official meetings and possibly a <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/south-korea-presses-diplomatic-offensive-with-north-1.328085">high level summit</a>. On the other hand, U.S.-North Korea relations, in the wake of the Sony hacking incident and new sanctions, have seen <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30670884">better days</a>. But the overall tendency of the Obama administration has been to follow the lead of Seoul on North Korea issues. The upshot: barring wild card provocations similar to the 2010 Yeonpyeong-do shelling or long-range missile or nuclear tests, always a possibility under Kim Jong Un, the next couple of months should look more like 2014 than 2013.

Overall, Key Resolve and Foal Eagle tend to churn up a broad range of issues beyond military exercises. But the U.S. and South Korea, for good reason, try to keep them as focused as possible on the business at hand: ensuring the joint readiness of U.S. and ROK forces to counter an ever-evolving North Korean threat. Fewer sideshows mean that systems, old and new, can be tested without distraction. This year the littoral combat ship USS Fort Worth, tailored for shallow coastal waters like those surrounding island flashpoints in the East and South China Seas, will be incorporated into Foal Eagle <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-17/u-s-coastal-combat-ship-to-debut-at-south-korea-military-drills">for the first time</a>. The results of this testing will have implications for U.S. and allied capabilities far beyond the peninsula. Let’s hope for a spring without fanfare.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>PLA’s Deeper Engagement in Military Drills Aligns with Xi’s Call for “Active” Chinese Diplomacy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Chinese President Xi Jinping last November delivered a keynote address to a <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1215680.shtml">Central Foreign Affairs Work Conference</a> (CFAWC) of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the first to be held under his stewardship as China’s top leader. Attending the meeting were all six of Xi’s Politburo Standing Committee colleagues, the rest of the full Politburo, China’s leading foreign policy practitioners, and hundreds of other officials from China’s provincial-level administrations, the military, state-owned enterprises, and the state bureaucracy. CFAWC’s are exceedingly rare, and offer a highly authoritative platform for the sitting CCP ruler to sketch the broad outlines of his foreign policy vision. In his speech, Xi laid out a sweeping policy agenda, suggesting that, despite the many domestic challenges he and his colleagues are facing at home, a proactive, balanced, and, where necessary, muscular foreign policy approach is likely to be a hallmark of Xi’s rule.

As a self-proclaimed acolyte of deceased paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, it is somewhat ironic that a major takeaway from Xi’s speech is the notion that its content seems to move China more rapidly away from Deng’s longstanding injunction for the country to maintain a low profile internationally. Xi made several comments in the speech that made this quite clear. He argued, for example, that China’s biggest opportunity lies in the determined leveraging and further development of its strength and influence internationally. He also said that “China should develop a distinctive diplomatic approach befitting its role [as] a major country.” So, in effect, Xi told his audience that China already is a great power, and should start acting like one.

Against this backdrop, the Chinese military’s more active, seemingly better coordinated participation in regional multilateral military exercises can be viewed as a key link in Xi’s overall foreign policy agenda. To be clear, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has been expanding its engagement in regional military affairs for some time, and its efforts to enlarge its regional military diplomatic footprint certainly predate Xi’s arrival as China’s top leader. But, while increasing in raw numbers, these initiatives largely were ad hoc in nature and reflected a cautious testing of the waters rather than an integrated and confident approach to military statecraft.

By contrast, since arriving on the scene, Xi has seemed to put far more energy—and been willing to expend the corresponding political capital—than his predecessors into ensuring that China’s military activities abroad are in line and keep pace with its overall foreign economic and diplomatic strategy. The most obvious example of Xi’s imprint on China’s military diplomacy is the steady improvement in ties between the PLA and the United States military since Xi took the helm as China’s commander-in-chief. The warming in U.S.-China defense ties has, in turn, helped facilitate China’s more robust participation in multilateral military exercises by signaling regional players that neither China nor the United States expects them to make a choice between the world’s two most influential powers when it comes to building military cooperation and capacity in East Asia.

There is little doubt that more focused initiative on China’s part coupled with a more welcoming environment for its engagement in multilateral military activity is bearing fruit. In just the last year, the PLA has participated in an expanding range of military fora, and these have included many firsts for the Chinese. The PLA’s inclusion in the U.S.-led Rim of the Pacific Exercise (RIMPAC) last July, for example, marked its inaugural foray as a non-observer in the world’s largest international maritime exercise. Among other <a href="http://eng.mod.gov.cn/DefenseNews/2015-01/17/content_4565350_3.htm">ongoing bilateral and multilateral military exercises</a> in the Asia Pacific, China and Malaysia held their first joint-military exercise in late 2014, and China and ASEAN signed their first <a href="http://www.asean.org/news/asean-secretariat-news/item/asean-and-china-sign-agreement-on-disaster-management">humanitarian and disaster relief (HADR) cooperation agreement</a> in that same timeframe. China joined U.S.-Australia military drills for the first time in October 2014, and, most recently, the PLA took part in February’s Cobra Gold maneuvers, the largest multilateral military exercise in the Asia Pacific that began as a bilateral U.S.-Thailand drill in the 1980s.

These trends dovetail neatly with Xi’s emphasis in his CFAWC speech on more focused, and more adept, regional diplomacy. Xi made repeated references in his comments to the need for Beijing to adopt “win-win” strategies in its approach to its neighbors, and he suggested several new elements to be added to the country’s diplomatic toolkit—such as specific references to systematically developing Chinese soft power—to achieve that aim. China’s greater interest in HADR activities clearly aligns with this priority. In fact, if increased involvement in regional disaster relief drills corresponds to increased responsiveness, China’s role in Asia’s next natural disaster will bear little semblance to its response to the horrific 2004 Asian tsunami. Unlike a decade ago when China lacked the capacity to respond effectively and in a timely fashion and was concerned how a substantial PLA deployment—even as part of a rescue mission—would be perceived in the region, China now views HADR as a critical component of its claims to be following a “good neighbor” policy that attests to China’s “peaceful rise.”

Despite China’s growing track record of success in increasing the effectiveness of its military diplomacy, however, its rigid adherence to strict definitions of its territorial sovereignty in its maritime disputes with many of its neighbors risks putting hard constraints on the credibility of its message of “win-win” outcomes for the region as Beijing’s influence and ability to project power continue to rise. China’s initially stingy donation to relief efforts in the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan struck in 2013 and its refusal to participate in the Japan-led humanitarian RIMPAC exercise suggest that it still is struggling to resolve the seeming contradictions between its presumably genuine commitment to its peaceful rise and its uncompromising commitment to its sovereignty claims. Unfortunately, Xi’s CFAWC speech provides no clear pathway for addressing this conundrum. Perhaps China’s deepening engagement in regional military maneuvers can play a role in helping square that circle as it becomes more confident in its standing as a welcome player in such efforts to strengthen regional capacity to address future collective security challenges in the Asia Pacific.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Contribution of Maritime Exercises to U.S. South China Sea Policy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The U.S. policy approach to maritime disputes in the South China Sea is primarily diplomatic but not entirely so. While it focuses on creating stability by exhorting all the parties to follow the rules (international law) and explicitly defines how Washington would like conflicts to be solved (peacefully); it does not neglect hard-power initiatives aimed at redressing some of the power imbalance between the ASEAN states of Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei and China. Finally, it incorporates an element of deterrence by not ignoring America’s security alliance with the Philippines.

<em>U.S. Military Access</em>

Importantly, Administration policy recognizes the importance of access for U.S. military presence in Southeast Asia proximate to the South China Sea. To that end it has improved America’s long standing access agreement with Singapore by adding the eventual rotational presence of four frigate class surface warships (currently called Littoral Combat Ships) to the U.S. military footprint in Singapore. Of equal significance, it has made plans to increase U.S. rotational presence in the Philippines. The April 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) between Washington and Manila provides for rotational U.S. military presence in Philippine territory. This agreement, which will be in force for 10 years, will permit U.S. forces to have extensive access to Philippine military facilities, including the former U.S. air and naval facilities at Clark air base and Subic Bay naval base. The EDCA also includes in its charter U.S. support for the long-term modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), with the goal of putting a place a “<a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/05/analyzing-the-us-philippines-enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement/">minimum credible defense</a>.”

<em>Access Improves Presence</em>

The access agreements with Singapore and the Philippines are important because they facilitate routine U.S. military presence in Southeast Asia, especially with littoral South China Sea states. Being “present” in a geographic sense equates to <em>proximity.</em> In turn, proximity yields influence and options. It also reassures friends and allies in the region that the United States has not militarily “abandoned” the South China Sea to the PLA. Port visits play an important role engendering presence. For example, over the past few years the frequency of routine U.S. Navy port visits to Philippine has increased steadily. In 2011 there were 44 ship visits, they <a href="http://www.navytimes.com/article/20130727/NEWS/307270004/Navy-wants-expand-Philippine-presence-create-temporary-base">doubled to 88 in 2012</a>, and grew to 140 in 2013. This number does not include USN vessels that took part in the <a href="http://www.mb.com.ph/expect-more-us-navy-ship-visits-ambassador-goldberg/">relief efforts</a> in the aftermath of super-typhoon Yolanda. While port visits to Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia are not nearly as frequent as the Philippines, the combined total, assuming a normal visit of 3-4 days, means there is a U.S. naval presence either underway in the South China Sea or in-port somewhere around the South China Sea every day. This is an important visible demonstration of U.S. interests in that vital waterway.

<em>Access Facilitates Exercises</em>

Another way to increase both presence and improve partner capacity is through exercises. Improving partner capacity is an important aspect of Washington’s South China Sea policy agenda. For 20 years now, the U.S. Navy has organized a sequential series of bilateral exercises with South East Asian partners. Under the direction of the Commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet’s Task Force 73, stationed in Singapore, this multi-month long exercise known as Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT), conducts annual bilateral training with naval forces of Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand. Starting in the spring of each year, a U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps task group spends time with each participant country. This rolling series of exercises goes on for around seven months. The schedule of events and the nature of the training are tailored to the desires of each participant nation.

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">The exercises focus on operational proficiency and given the relative low-profile that has been a hallmark of the CARAT process, the size and breadth of the exercise series can be surprising. The 2014 CARAT “season” which ran from May to November involved more than 40 U.S. and regional partner ships, 50 U.S. and international maritime patrol aircraft and embarked helicopters, and totaled more than 10,000 personnel. Importantly for South China Sea littoral participants, training with U.S. Marines in actual amphibious operations was part of the exercise program. Additionally, the most recent CARAT included U.S. Navy Seabees, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technicians, medical professionals, and diving experts. CARAT 2014 involved more than 150 days of <a href="http://www.public.navy.mil/surfor/cds7/Pages/working-with-a-region-on-the-rise-reflections-on-carat-2014.aspx#.VPORufnF-jI">interaction</a> that included both planning conferences, shore based seminars and the actual operational exercises themselves. It should be noted that in addition to CARAT the U.S. military also conducts separate bilateral exercises with a number of Southeast Asian nations.</span>

<em><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Recommendations</span></em>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Over the years CARAT participation has grown as more Southeast and South Asian nations have asked to become participants. As impressive as the CARAT process has become, one way to increase U.S. presence in the South China Sea while improving partner capacity would be to increase the duration of the CARAT exercise segments with Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. Reaching an agreement with Vietnam to participate in CARAT would also be very helpful. Inviting participation from other Asian maritime states, such as Japan, Australia, South Korea and possibly India should also be considered, since it would illustrate that other Asian maritime states are also concerned about stability in the South China Sea.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">That said, it would not be wise to overtly militarize the U.S. approach to the South China Sea. Diplomatic and trade initiatives should remain Washington’s primary policy approaches. China has been at pains to minimize the direct involvement of the PLA in its efforts to enforce its writ in the South China Sea. This does not mean that the PLA Navy has not also been routinely present in the South China Sea because it has. It too conducts routine exercises and daily presence operations that include resupply of PLA garrisons in the Spratlys and is normally “just over the horizon” in support of its coast guard. Increased U.S. presence, especially air and naval, will reassure friends and allies and indicate that the U.S. is committed to a long term posture in Southeast Asia dedicated to improving the maritime security of the region.</span>]]></content:encoded>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Interview Transcript</strong></span>

<strong>Mira Rapp Hooper</strong>: Hello everyone, I’m Mira Rapp Hooper, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative and I’m very pleased to be here today with Admiral Gary Roughead. Thank you so much for joining us today.

<strong>Admiral Gary Roughead</strong>: Mira it’s a true pleasure to be here with you and talking about something I think is extremely important.

<strong>MRH:</strong> Admiral Roughead is the former chief of naval operations in addition to an AMTI contributor and he’s agreed to join me today to have a conversation about military exercises in E Asia. I’d like to start out today by asking you to sort of tease out for us the sort of underlying purposes of military exercises and of course there can be many. We can think of combined military exercises as helping to bolster the relationship between allies. We can think of them as a state like the United States demonstrating its presence reinforcing deterrence through military exercises and we can even think of exercises as serving a role between potential adversaries, helping to reduce tensions between them. So could you just tell us a bit in general terms about how each of these three dynamics are playing out in East Asia.

<strong>AGR:</strong> Well I think you’ve captured it very nicely as to what the purposes of the exercises are. But as you know in Asia Pacific region we do hundreds of exercises and we use the term combined because that brings that countries together. Most often in Asia they tend to be bilateral exercises meaning two countries that are exercising in particular areas. We in the United States like to do more multilateral exercises, bringing more parties into the process. As you said they serve many functions, they demonstrate our presence, they demonstrate our commitment to the security and prosperity of the region, they enable political relationships to evolve with the military underpinning, a security underpinning. But they also are great for our people to be able to practice their skills, but to be able to do it with (in my case the Navy) sailors of other countries. And you build the relationships that are extraordinarily important. All too often we focus on the exercise proper, when the ships get together at sea and you do various evolutions. But these exercises are really months in the planning and the activities that take place between the planners from the United States and the other country or other countries really begin to develop relationships that are lasting that they are there to be used or to be reenergized for example if there’s a disaster that strikes the region it is not uncommon, for example, when we have an event an earthquake or a tsunami or a typhoon and we know that we’re going to be working with the other countries, the first place we go to is your contact list of the planners that you’ve worked with on other exercises. So the value of these exercises that we run are significant and they’re very, very valuable and again not just the exercise itself but the planning process, the discussions that take place, the relationships that build, really important for our role in the region and they contribute greatly to the security of the region.

<strong>MRH:</strong> When you think about how exercises in the region are evolving I’m curious for your thoughts on how China’s role in exercises may be shifting. In particular, has the leadership of the People’s Liberation Army changed their views (in so far as you can tell) towards combined exercises in the region? And how is the relationship between the U.S. and China been shifting when it comes to military exercises?

<strong>AGR:</strong> Well I think the PLA has changed their views a bit. What we’ve seen recently for example, a major development, was the participation of the PLA Navy in the Rim of the Pacific Exercise. We’ve seen recently a humanitarian exercise in Hawaii with PLA forces that are there. But it seems to me still to be a bit lopsided. In other words, the PLA is participating in exercises that we’re hosting, and I think that’s a very positive thing but I believe that in order for there to be a significant change in the way that the PLA and the U.S. military will exercise and get into a more normal or a more routine process is that I really do believe that the PLA needs to host some exercises in and around China. I also believe that it’s important for the PLA to begin to move into more multilateral exercises. As you know RIMPAC is perhaps one of the largest multilateral exercises in the world. It clearly is the largest naval exercise in the world. And when I’ve talked to some of my PLA interlocutors about doing something similar in China I was always told “Well we don’t do multilateral exercises.” But I think that it’s time that the PLA really needs to begin to think differently about how they want to play the role in the region and begin to do a bit more hosting of these exercises in and around China.

<strong>MRH:</strong> Can you tell us a bit more about why the PLA leadership might have traditionally not been engaging in multilateral exercises? And what sorts of changes might be required to shift them more in that direction?

<strong>AGR:</strong> Well I think that one, multilateral exercises are far more complex, they take into account not only different militaries but also in the region you have to take into account the different politics that may exist among the different countries. I think the bilateral is much easier it is something that they have been doing for a long time and I’m hopeful that we’ll see a change but I think a lot of it is the way it has always been done but it’s also much easier to work bilateral “affects” if you will without bringing in all the other countries. I do believe and we’ve seen so many times and I alluded to why these exercises are important that when you come together in response to an event whether it’s a humanitarian issue, some climate event that may take place, you tend to come together multi-nationally and it really does pay to have practiced in that type of scheme of venue and I think that China really needs to begin to move down that path.

<strong>MRH:</strong> Shifting to other U.S. friends and allies in the region, I wonder if you could share with us your thoughts on what India’s evolving role in military exercises in the region is likely to look like?

<strong>AGR:</strong> Well I think that India will be much more active in military exercises in what I would call the Indo-Pacific because clearly their primary interest is really the Indian Ocean the sea lanes that are in the Indian Ocean and the approaches to that ocean whether it’s coming out of the Straits of Hormuz or the Straits of Malacca. Malabar is a longstanding exercise that we’ve conducted with the Indian Navy and we’ve included the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force and I think Malabar, particularly when you bring together the U.S., India and Japan you’re bringing together three of the most capable naval forces in the region. The Indian Navy is very professional, very competent, they operate significant technology in their navy. Japan – very much the same. And then when you bring in Australia, that just adds to it and you’re really playing at a level that’s pretty sophisticated when you’re working with those navies. And I would add in opportunities for Singapore. Small navy but extraordinarily competent, extraordinarily professional and very comfortable with working out of the region. As you may know the Singaporeans have contributed significantly with some of the coalition task forces in the north Arabian Sea and in the Gulf. I think that there’s tremendous potential to really step up the level of exercises among India, Australia, the U.S. and as I said Japan and Singapore as well. So I think that you will begin to see more exercise activity, more complex exercise activity. Because as you may know the Indians also operate aircraft carriers, they’re very competent submariners. SO I think you’re going to start to see some of that play out in the coming years.

<strong>MRH:</strong> AMTI and many major media outlets in the world have recently been paying some very close attention to China’s building activities in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. Should we expect to see an increase in military exercises in the South China Sea in the coming years? And if so, would you anticipate that these would be exercises that involve more countries, that are longer in duration, that are targeting specific locations that they may not have operated around before? What is your vision of the role that combined exercises might play in managing the tensions in the South China Sea?

<strong>AGR:</strong> I think that the exercises can go a long way to managing tensions. That said, I’m not sure that we’re going to see a rapid rise in the level of activities, because as you well know, there are other disputes that are in play in the South China Sea. And so operating in that area is always quite sensitive; and so I think that will be tempering the pace perhaps, that the exercises will move forward. I also believe that we will see perhaps China just exercising more unilaterally in the South China Sea, which will be very discomforting for the countries in the region. But I really do think that as they have built out capabilities in the South China Sea, and the infrastructure improvements that have been made, that have given what before were very, very small islands or islets in the region; they’ve now provided an opportunity to employ some fairly significant military capability from them. So I think the first thing we will see is more Chinese unilateral activity and assertion of their views with regard to the South China Sea. I think that that will cause other countries to want to exercise and participate, but in the background will be some of these underlying sensitivities among the countries in the region. So I think that’s probably how we’ll see it play out.

<strong>MRH:</strong> Can you talk a bit about how resourcing affects the future of military exercises in the Pacific and elsewhere?

<strong>AGR:</strong> I think, you know, it’s a very real fact that has to be considered; and it’s easy to say ‘well let’s go do an exercise with Country X or Country Y’, but there are really several factors that come into play in an exercise. One is the political relationships that exist, and are the countries comfortable operating militarily with one other. Then, there is the question of military compatibility. Because the region has such a range of countries with varying levels of military technology and experience, you have to take a look at that. But then, you really come down to the fact that do you have the forces that can be put toward that exercise, or are they off doing other things, are they back in a maintenance period. And then just the money that you spend on fuel, and ammunition, and all the food and support that goes out into a maritime exercise. So you have to consider that, and you really have to consider it not just from the standpoint of the US, because it’s very easy as our ships move through the area, because of our permanent presence there, to exercise quite frequently. But we have to keep in mind that for some countries, the cost of an exercise can be a fairly significant part of their budget; and so the pace with which exercises play out really have to take into account resources, and in the case of the US it’s no different. Our men and women who are forward deployed in the region are very busy, and they’re also having to deal with many of the same things that I’ve talked about. As you look at this exercise planning process, that sometimes begins a year or two years in advance, depending on the complexity of the exercise, you have to have an assurance that those resources are going to be there; and in the case of the United States, with some of the uncertainties surrounding our budget, with the uncertainties surrounding the budget control act, and sequestration; when you start to look that far out, when you don’t have that certainty, it makes it a little difficult to plan. So resources are important, predictability is key, because the last thing you want to do is to cancel out at the last minute after people have put a lot of effort and money into preparing for these exercises. So resources are always pretty significant for all the countries that are participating.

<strong>MRH:</strong> Admiral Roughead thank you so much for joining us today and sharing your wisdom.

<strong>AGR:</strong> My pleasure, thank you very much.]]></content:encoded>

The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) is generally considered among the weakest in the region. But as China gradually chips away at the Philippines’ hold on and claims to a whole host of land features as well as fisheries and hydrocarbon resources within its 200-nautical-miles Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), there has been a much more concerted effort at ramping up the Southeast Asian country’s defensive capabilities, particularly under the administration of President Benigno Aquino III.

On December 2012, Aquino oversaw the passage of the <a href="http://www.dnd.gov.ph/pdf/IGRRP.pdf">Revised AFP Modernization Act</a>, amending the <a href="http://www.gppb.gov.ph/laws/laws/RA_7898.pdf">1995 AFP Modernization Act</a> and extending the AFP’s modernization for another 15 years. The aim is to develop the country’s <em>minimum deterrence capability</em> as well as its domain awareness across contested waters within the Philippines’ EEZ.  The AFP Modernization Act has served as the primary source of funds for procurements to augment the AFP’s capabilities, while the annual defense budget has largely been dedicated to compensation of personnel and maintenance of existing defense hardware.

In his first three years in office, President Aquino allocated <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2013/07/philippines-to-modernize-air-force-amid-china-row/">US$648.44 million to modernizing the AFP.</a> The year 2013 saw a 17% increase in defense spending, with Aquino allocating US$1.73 billion for defense procurement in the 2013-2017 period. The significant increase in defense spending and procurement funds came on the heels of a dangerous Philippine-China standoff over the Scarborough Shoal and the Philippines’ subsequent decision to initiate compulsory arbitration vis-à-vis territorial disputes in the South China.

<strong>Strategic Blunder </strong>

A toxic combination of chronic bureaucratic corruption, underinvestment and misallocation of funds, and an excessive focus on counter-insurgency and internal security operations has contributed to the AFP’s awry state of affairs. The Philippine constitution also <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2013/08/modernizing-the-philippine-military/">obliges the government</a> to ensure education spending always outstrips defense expenditures.

Additionally, the Philippines has an age-old strategic culture of overreliance on American military support -- under the aegis of the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT), and through the Excess Defense Articles, the Military Assistance, and the Foreign Military Sales programs -- against external threats. The termination of American military presence on Philippine soil (1992) as well as the formal cessation of hostilities with the Moro National Liberation Front (1996), the country’s largest insurgency group at the time, however, provided a unique opportunity for the Philippines to modernize the AFP. China’s coercive occupation of the <a href="http://www.china-briefing.com/news/2011/05/31/chinas-territorial-disputes-in-the-south-china-sea-and-east-china-sea.html">Mischief Reef in 1995</a> underlined the urgency of the matter.

Through the<a href="http://www.gppb.gov.ph/laws/laws/RA_7898.pdf"> 1995 AFP Modernization Act</a>, the Ramos administration (1992-1998) sought to transform the AFP into a modern, capable, and self-reliant force against external aggression. But misallocation of funds and bureaucratic corruption undermined the modernization of the AFP. Peace negotiations with leading rebel groups also failed to <a href="http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/publications/by-type/book-series/primed-and-purposeful.html">end decades-old insurgency</a> in the Muslim-majority and under-developed regions of the country. It didn’t take long before the Philippines had to invite the U.S. back to the Philippines, culminating in the <a href="http://www.gov.ph/1998/02/10/agreement-between-the-government-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-and-the-government-of-the-united-states-of-america-regarding-the-treatment-of-united-states-armed-forces-visiting-the-philippines-f/">1998 Visiting Forces Agreement</a>.

Ramos’ successors, particularly Joseph Estrada (1998-2001) and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (2001-2010), were primarily focused on domestic insurgency. The “Global War on Terror” saw robust bilateral cooperation between the Bush administration and its Filipino counterpart against al-Qaeda-affiliate groups in Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, the Estrada and Arroyo administrations primarily relied on bilateral and multilateral (under the aegis of the ASEAN) diplomacy to manage territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Under the Arroyo administration, there was a <a href="http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?id=151215">significant improvement in Philippine-China relations</a>, culminating in the trilateral <a href="http://csis.org/publication/jmsu-tale-bilateralism-and-secrecy-south-china-sea">2005 Joint Maritime Seismic Understanding (JMSU) agreement</a> in the South China Sea.

<strong>Catch Up Time</strong>

Aquino’s rise to power in 2010, however, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/24/world/asia/24diplo.html?_r=0">coincided with rising tensions</a> in the South China Sea, especially as China <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/chinas-self-made-disaster-the-south-china-sea-10618">ramped up its</a> paramilitary patrols, military drills, and construction activities in the area. Accordingly, the Philippines’ defense spending increased from $1.24 billion in 2004 to $2.3 billion in 2009 and $3.47 billion in 2013, a 36 percent increase in less than a decade. By 2015, the Philippines defense spending is expected to <a href="http://www.janes.com/article/41426/philippines-proposes-29-defence-budget-increase">grow by as much as 29%</a> , bolstered by around <a href="http://www.congress.gov.ph/cpbo/images/PDF%20Attachments/Budget%20Briefer/2015%20DIMENSIONS.pdf">$450 million</a> from the Revise AFP Modernization Act. As a percentage of GDP, however, the Philippines’ defense spending has remained relatively constant, hovering at just around 1%.

Similar to President Ramos, Aquino <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/media-releases/2012/asia/the-philippines-breakthrough-in-mindanao.aspx">also vigorously pursued peace negotiations</a> with leading rebel groups to help the AFP to focus on external security. Under his watch, there has also been a more targeted focus on developing the Philippines’ naval and airforce capabilities. Since 2005, when the Philippines permanently retired its fleet of F-5 fighters, the country hasn’t fielded a single (modern) fighter aircraft. So Aquino signed (Feb. 2014) a deal with Korea Aerospace Industries for the <a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/99293/ph-to-buy-12-fighters-jets-from-south-korea/">delivery of twelve FA 50 lead-in fighter jets</a>, worth $415.7 million, with <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/78670-afp-modernization-status-2014-yearender">the first delivery expected</a> by December 2015 and to be completed by 2017.

Meanwhile, the Philippine Navy (PN) has <a href="http://www.janes.com/article/42243/philippine-navy-mulling-best-way-to-upgrade-del-pilar-frigates">gradually beefed up</a> its antiquated, miniscule fleet. The PN acquired the BRP Gregorio Del Pilar (PF15) and BRP Ramon Alcaraz (PF16), <em>Hamilton</em>- and <em>Hero-</em>class cutters worth up to $400 million, in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Since 2013, the Philippines has been on <a href="http://cogitasia.com/the-philippines-slowly-modernizes-its-defense-capabilities/">a shopping spree</a>, acquiring 28 M113 APCs from Israel; 5 Bell-205 helicopters from Germany; 8 helicopters from Poland, and 25 Humvees from the U.S. 8 <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/78670-afp-modernization-status-2014-yearender">By 2015,</a> 8 Bell-412 combat utility helicopters and 8 AW109 Power attack helicopters are set to be delivered.

Allies are also pitching in. In 2014, <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/06/us-reduces-security-assistance-to-asia/">Washington increased its</a> Foreign Military Financing to the Philippines to $40 million, with $14.5 million earmarked for the enhancement of the Philippines’ surveillance and maritime security capabilities. The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) is also set to benefit from the delivery of the <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/590453/patrol-boats-from-japan-to-start-arriving-in-2015">first 3 of 10 multi-role patrol boats</a> from Japan by the third quarter of 2015, while South Korea <a href="http://www.philstar.com/news-feature/2014/06/24/1338490/meet-south-koreas-guided-missile-warship-philippines">has donated</a> a Pohang-class corvette to the PN.

The Philippines has experienced arguably its most significant defense buildup under the Aquino administration, but it is far from clear whether the country will develop a minimum deterrence capability anytime soon to push back against China’s relentless assertiveness in the South China Sea.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Taiwan’s Defense Spending: The Security Consequences of Choosing Butter over Guns</title>

The People’s Republic of China (PRC) announced on March 4 that it would raise its defense budget by 10.1 percent in 2015, which continues an almost unbroken pattern of double-digit annual increases over the past two decades. Meanwhile, defense spending by the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan, which faces an ever-growing military threat from the PRC, has languished. In 2015, Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense's (MND) budget saw its first bump in funds since 2012 – <a href="http://www.janes.com/article/42661/taiwan-announces-2-6-budget-increase">a 2.6 percent increase </a>from $10.5 to $10.7 billion USD.  For the first time in seven years, defense spending as a percentage of total government spending will rise, but only .2 percent. Since 2008, the MND budget has decreased as a percentage of Taiwan’s GDP – currently hovering just above 2 percent, well below President Ma Ying-jeou’s pledge to sustain an investment in defense of not less than 3 percent.

The disparity between the size of the PRC economy ($10.35 trillion) and Taiwan’s economy ($517.02 billion) makes it impossible for Taiwan to keep pace with Chinese defense spending. However, Taiwan’s preference in recent years for butter over guns is jeopardizing its security in two ways. First, Taiwan’s diminishing ability to maintain a credible deterrent against an attack from Mainland China could provide incentives for Beijing to pressure Taiwan to engage in political talks or use military force to achieve its objective of reunification. With the real possibility of a return to power in 2016 of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has traditionally supported Taiwan independence, Taiwan’s growing vulnerability could tempt Chinese President Xi Jinping to adopt a more coercive or even violent approach. Second, Taipei’s low defense spending raises questions about Taiwan’s commitment to its own defense, which could have implications for U.S. willingness to help defend the island in the event of a PRC attack.

Why, then, is Taiwan not allocating greater resources to defense?  A major factor is the improvement in cross-Strait relations, which has importantly lowered the risk of conflict, but has also <a href="http://www.mac.gov.tw/public/Attachment/472810562541.gif">reduced public perception</a> of the threat from Mainland China. Since coming to power in 2008, Taiwan’s President Ma Ying-jeou has overseen a new phase of stabilization in China-Taiwan relations in which economic and social exchanges have expanded dramatically. As a result, Taiwan’s citizens’ fears of a military attack have receded. Other concerns have emerged instead, including rising unemployment, the widening income gap between rich and poor, growing government debt, the challenges posed by an aging population, and a variety of social issues.

The trend of declining defense spending as a share of government spending (from 2008 to 2013) and GDP (from 2008 to 2014) has not gone unnoticed by Washington.  The <a href="http://www.defense.gov/pubs/2013_china_report_final.pdf">U.S. Department of Defense’s report to Congress</a> <em>Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2013</em>, lamented Taiwan’s choice to spend more on personnel salaries while “diverting funds from foreign and indigenous [weapons] acquisition programs.” At the same time, however, the U.S. has commended the efforts of Taiwan’s military to make the most of its limited funds by focusing on an asymmetrical homeland defense strategy. For example, <a href="http://www.defense.gov/pubs/2014_DoD_China_Report.pdf">DoD’s 2014 report</a> highlighted Taiwan’s procurement of fast-attack boats, armed helicopters, radar systems, and other key anti-amphibious assault capabilities. Taiwan has also sought to strengthen indigenous defense production. This is essential as no country other than the U.S. is willing to supply Taiwan with weapons in the face of growing Chinese power. There is also recognition that MND is focused on realizing President Ma’s commitment to shift Taiwan from a conscription-based force to a smaller, more professionalized all-volunteer military – an expensive transition.

But are these measures sufficient to deter an attack from the Mainland and bolster U.S. confidence that Taiwan will defend itself, if necessary?  Then-Minister of National Defense Yen Ming projected in 2013 that Taiwan’s military forces could hold off a PRC invasion by themselves for the grim estimate of only <a href="http://news.usni.org/2014/03/26/taiwan-defend-chinese-attack">one month</a>. Even that prediction is likely overly optimistic. The <a href="http://report.mnd.gov.tw/en/m/minister.html">2013 National Defense Report</a>, which is the latest one issued, assessed that China will have the capability to forcibly reunite Taiwan and the Mainland by 2020.  It judged that the PRC’s intelligence, ground forces, navy and air force are making significant progress towards acquiring capabilities to blockade Taiwan’s sea routes and control the air space, as well as to deter third parties from intervening during a Chinese assault.

More resources are evidently needed.  The DPP promises to raise the defense budget to 3 percent of GDP if it returns to power, but many observers are skeptical that it would follow through on this pledge. After all, when the DPP was the ruling party, defense spending dropped annually as a percentage of GDP from 2.9 in 2001 to 2.1 in 2006, and then inched upwards to 2.4 percent in 2007, its final year in office. This suggests that regardless of which party is elected in 2016, significant increases in defense spending are unlikely. Competing pressures from the electorate to support social welfare programs means that a marginal reversal of the current downward trend is the best case scenario.

Taiwan cannot outspend China and it cannot prevent the cross-Strait capabilities gap from widening. But Taiwan can raise the costs and risks to the PRC of an attack, which would likely reduce the possibility that Beijing will opt to use military force to achieve its goals. To do so, Taiwan must devote greater resources to defense spending. This will require explaining to the people of Taiwan that the Chinese military threat is growing even though cross-Strait relations have improved, and that therefore the island must have an effective defense. If Taiwan fails to spend adequately on its security, besides weakening deterrence, it will also increase doubts in the U.S. about Taiwan’s commitment to defend itself—doubts that could lead to the erosion of American support to defend Taiwan in a crisis.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Fixed Budget, Dynamic Defense in Japan</title>

As AMTI readers know well, tensions between Japan and China over the Senkaku Islands have been running high since 2010. Despite a partial thaw when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with President Xi Jinping last December, Beijing continues to put steady pressure on Tokyo’s control of the islands with regular maritime and aerial incursions and double-digit growth in defense spending.  Yet Tokyo’s defense spending has remained low, consistent with historical trends.  Japan’s defense budget topline has not changed much in recent years and is unlikely to be overhauled in the near future. Nonetheless, Tokyo’s spending clearly reveals a newfound focus on so-called “grey zone” contingencies like the Senkakus.

Since the 1970s Japan has maintained defense spending at or below approximately one percent of GDP. As a percentage of total government spending, defense comprises only 2.5 percent. Despite the recent regional challenges posed by China’s military modernization and North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile development, these historic limits on Japanese defense spending have remained firmly in place. Between 2003 and 2012, Japanese defense spending actually declined, but rose again in FY 2013, 2014, and 2015. For the last three years it has stood at approximately 4.8 trillion yen annually. Released in December 2013 alongside its most recent National Defense Program Guidelines, Tokyo’s Mid-Term Defense Program established a defense expenditure limit of JPY 23.97 trillion (205.1 billion USD) for the 2014-2018 period. This spending cap means that Tokyo cannot continue to increase its annual budget as it has done the last three years, or the cap itself will need to be raised. Within these stringent limits, however, Tokyo’s defense priorities indicate that it is increasingly focused on the defense of the Senkakus.

Japan’s 2013 <a href="http://www.mod.go.jp/j/approach/agenda/guideline/2014/pdf/20131217_e2.pdf">National Defense Program Guidelines</a> emphasize Tokyo’s concern over so-called “grey zone” contingencies—situations that lie somewhere between peace and full-scale war and include conflicts over sovereignty, territory, and maritime interests. Japan’s procurement patterns demonstrate that grey zone island defense has quickly become a security priority, and Tokyo is prioritizing naval and air systems and personnel. In the last ten years and since 2010 in particular, the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) and Air Self-Defense Forces (JASDF) budgets have increased modestly, while the Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) budget has decreased slightly.

<a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SDF-Branches-Chart.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2912" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SDF-Branches-Chart.png" alt="SDF Branches Chart" width="582" height="230" /></a>

&nbsp;
<h5><strong>Source: Japan Ministry of Defense</strong></h5>
More than each service’s overall budget, however, Japanese procurement patterns demonstrate a clear shift towards air and maritime defense.  The FY2015 JASDF budget includes JPY 51.6 billion for <a href="http://www.copybook.com/military/news/japan-seeks-v-22-ospreys-for-naval-ops">five V-22 Osprey</a> tilt-rotor aircraft, which are particularly useful for maritime operations. It included JPY 23.2 billion towards a new E-2D Hawkeye tactical early warning aircraft squadron and JPY15.4 billion for four Northrop Grumman RQ-4s Global Hawk UAVs—both assets for sea and air surveillance. The JASDF budget also included JPY 16.4 billion for a new medium-range coastal air-defense system.

The JMSDF procurement budget underscores the grey zone mission even more clearly. Tokyo allocated JPY 350.4 billion for a bulk order of 20 P-1 maritime patrol aircraft to replace its aging P-3 Orion fleet, and JPY 20.3 billion to purchase 30 AAV-7 amphibious assault craft from the United States. The 2013 NDPG requires Tokyo to maintain a destroyer fleet of 54 vessels, up from 48, and Japan is expanding its Aegis fleet with a new <em>Atago-</em>class destroyer and buying the Aegis system for a second ship for a total of JPY 168 billion. Japan is in the process of increasing its submarine fleet from 16 to 22 vessels and in FY15 will spend JPY 64.3 billion to build its 11th <em>Soryu</em>-class diesel-electric submarine. It is also in the process of developing a new class of helicopter carrier (or helicopter destroyer), the <em>Izumo. </em>

Perhaps most indicative of Tokyo’s priorities are the changes in the Ground Self-Defense Force budget. The overall GSDF budget has been cut modestly in recent years, and ground force personnel numbers have been reduced, while those in other services remain constant.

<iframe src="http://live.amcharts.com/TYxYz/embed/" width="600" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>

But the JGSDF is also clearly being reoriented towards a maritime expeditionary mission. The JGSDF budget traditionally included substantial investments in tanks, artillery, and armored vehicles, but the JGSDF has cut hundreds of these systems in just the last several years. Instead, Japan’s ground forces are investing in their own amphibious vehicles. Notably, Tokyo has also stood up a new unit modeled on the U.S. Marines and <a href="http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/politics/AJ201210280056">placed this</a> within the JGSDF. Couple a slightly lower budget with fewer armor and artillery units with this new amphibious capability –as well as recent joint JSDF exercises with the U.S. Marines--it is clear that Japan’s ground forces are also being put to sea.

In the coming months, we can expect Japan to do more to further its island defense mission. Prime Minister Abe is making substantial progress towards reinterpreting Japan’s constitution to allow the exercise of the right of collective self-defense, which will allow for closer operational planning and cooperation with the United States. Tokyo and Washington are also nearly finished revising the Bilateral Defense Guidelines that support the alliance, and these will also place emphasis on grey zone contingencies. Additionally, in April 2014 Tokyo eased its self-imposed ban on arms exports to allow it to transfer defense equipment, and this has resulted in new defense cooperation with Australia, the United Kingdom, France, India, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Despite regional trends, Japan’s historically low defense spending is unlikely to see an uptick in the near future. Nonetheless, we can expect Tokyo to take a more active regional defense role and prioritize the Senkaku mission despite these longstanding constraints.]]></content:encoded>

Vietnam boosted its military spending by 113 percent between 2004 and 2013, the largest increase among Southeast Asian countries. Defense spending has accounted for around 2 percent of the country’s gross domestic product since 2004. Total spending was $3.3 billion in 2012 and $3.4 billion in 2013 (the latest year for which figures are available), and according to <em>IHS Jane’s</em>, signed military procurement contracts in 2014 worth $1.4 billion.

The year 2011 marked a turning point for Vietnam’s defense spending. That year the Central Committee of the ruling Communist Party issued a detailed maritime strategy for 2011-2020, making the protection of maritime sovereignty and the maritime economy key national security pillars. Vietnam has a 2,000-mile coastline facing the South China Sea and 50 percent of its population living along the coast, and the government sees its largest security threat as external and maritime in nature.

The Vietnamese Navy and Air Force, which until the early 2000s had little capacity to protect Vietnam’s maritime interests, have over the past decade undergone rapid modernization. Russia is Vietnam’s main arms supplier thanks to ties dating back to the Cold War. The major platforms acquired since 2011 served to upgrade Vietnam’s ability to conduct sea denial operations off its coast and around military installations in the disputed Spratly islands.

<iframe src="http://live.amcharts.com/5NjNl/embed/" width="600" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Most notably, the <em>Kilo</em>-class submarine deal, signed in 2009 with Russia, is worth approximately $3.2 billion and includes submarines and construction of a submarine facility at the deep water port in Cam Ranh Bay. The Navy is expected to operate a total of six Kilo-class submarines by 2017. The first two have been on training runs for the past year and could be sent further offshore soon.

Vietnam received two <em>Gepard</em>-class guided missile stealth frigates from Russia in 2011 at a cost of $300 million and, by mid-2017, will operate six <em>Gepard</em>-class frigates. The first two received were configured to respond to surface attacks. Two others will have anti-submarine warfare capabilities and two are expected be equipped with air defense missiles. These will be the Navy’s most valuable assets until it receives four <em>Sigma</em>-class corvettes equipped with Exocet missiles from the Netherlands in the coming years.

Four <em>Svetlyak</em>-class fast patrol boats with anti-ship missiles have been received from Russia since 2010. The Navy also operates a dozen frigates or corvettes that were either from the Soviet era or co-manufactured with Russia more recently. In 2014, the Navy added its first two <em>Molniya</em>-class missile fast attack ships, built domestically but based on Russian designs, and it is expecting four more by the end of 2016.

The Air Force acquired 24 Su-30 MK2 fighter jets from Russia during the past decade, and recently ordered another 12 for over $1.6 billion. By the end of 2015, it will operate 36 Su-30 MK2 jets. These advanced, anti-ship missile-capable aircraft will join a fleet of about 50 older Su-27 and Su-22 models and over 140 aging Vietnam War-era MiG-21s.

Vietnam has ordered six DHC-6 twin otter seaplanes from Canada, three of which have been received. Reports by <em>IHS Jane’s</em> last year said Vietnam had ordered three C295 military transport aircraft from Spain for $100 million.  Chinese sources claim that Vietnam plans to convert these aircraft for early warning purposes, long a weakness of Vietnam’s air force. The new C295s will enter service in 2015, joining a fleet of over 50 Soviet-built transport planes that Vietnam already operates.

Vietnam has also continuously upgraded its defensive missile systems. It put in place two batteries of the K-300P Bastion coastal missile system in 2011 and two batteries of the S-300 PMU-2 long-range surface-to-air missile systems in 2012. In 2014, Vietnam upgraded both its short-range surface-to-air missile systems and coastal missile systems. The military has been boosting its coastal surveillance radar systems since 2013, and successfully built its first unmanned aerial vehicle in 2013.

The government has allocated over $950 million since 2014 to upgrade law enforcement capabilities for its Coast Guard and Fisheries Surveillance Force, according to Vietnamese news reports. While it has spent more lavishly on the Navy, Vietnam relies largely on its Coast Guard and Fisheries Surveillance Force for patrolling and protecting Vietnamese interests in the South China Sea.

The Coast Guard currently is believed to have around 38 vessels ranging from 120 to 2,500 tons.  Many of these vessels were built domestically. The largest offshore patrol vessel, built by the Netherlands, will be equipped with naval helicopters for better maritime surveillance. The Coast Guard has added two CASA C-212 400 maritime patrol aircraft since 2011. The government in 2014 ordered the construction of 32 new patrol vessels and four large fisheries surveillance vessels, and in February began arming its fisheries surveillance units with military weapons.

The United States and Japan have emerged as Vietnam’s closest security partners over the past few years, given their shared concerns about China’s growing assertiveness and interest in maintaining freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. Washington in 2013 announced an $18 million maritime security assistance package for Hanoi and will transfer five coast guard cutters to Vietnam annually over the next five years.  The United States also has been training the country’s coast guard personnel. Vietnam will begin receiving decommissioned Japanese coast guard vessels in 2015.

Despite the Vietnamese government’s significant military modernization over the past five years, the task ahead remains daunting. Questions abound over whether the Navy and Air Force can absorb the added capacity in a relatively short time, whether the Coast Guard will be able to withstand stepped-up Chinese assertiveness at sea, and whether Hanoi can maintain the current level of spending in future years. Many defense officials in Washington are waiting for Vietnam to expand its coast guard cooperation, forge closer naval ties, and establish a defense procurement relationship with the United States.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Post-Reclamation Scenario in the South China Sea: The Role of China and the United States.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since 2014, China has attracted tremendous regional and international attention through its land reclamation activities in some features of the Spratlys which it controls, namely Gaven Reef, Cuarteron Reef, Johnson South Reef and Fiery Cross. While many have criticisms and concerns, China feels this reclamation is necessary in order to keep up with others in the Spratlys who have earlier occupied features in the disputed Spratlys and built up military and civil facilities since.

Very little can be said against China’s reclamation activities from the perspective of UNCLOS. Article 60 provides coastal states exclusive right to construct, operate and use artificial islands, installations and structures in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Pending the maritime delimitation of the EEZ and the continental shelf in the South China Sea, land reclamation has been conducted within twelve nautical miles of the four mentioned features, an area which may be defined as within a state’s sovereignty in its territorial sea around these features. More importantly, the artificial islands, installations and structures would not interfere with the legal status of these features. Nevertheless, China may still be blamed for ignoring the duties of “due notice,” “appropriate publicity,” and “undertaking environmental impact assessments.”

But a legal justification does not address the political implications and strategic calculations in this messy portrait of the South China Sea. What puts China “morally on trial,” in addition to explicit criticism from other claimant states, especially the Philippines and Vietnam, is overwhelming concern from the United States, which sees itself as a strategic ally of many countries in the region, a protector of the freedom of navigation, and a strategic competitor with China in the Asia-Pacific.

In the most recent report released by Center for New American Security, “Preserving the Rules: Countering Coercion in Maritime Asia”, Patrick Cronin proposes adopting cost-imposing measures to address China’s reclamation in the South China Sea. In this report, several recommendations are presented. These include: Further institutionalizing high-level military and civilian engagement with China; mobilizing regional and international opinion when states use coercion; mobilizing support for positive efforts to foster a rules-based order; building up maritime domain awareness; raising the non-military costs of coercion by moving forward with a binding code of conduct; building the naval capacity of friends and partners.

There are many important points that could be derived from the above statements. Though the United States has openly welcomed a rising China as a constructive competitor and a responsible stakeholder in the existing international order, the long standing territorial and maritime disputes in the South China Sea have put China in an awkward position in which it has to deal with the United States as an important stakeholder, in addition to its existing burden with other claimant states. Reclamation is not the only, or even the major driver, of the gradual tension in the disputed South China Sea. The divergent legal interpretations of “the legitimacy of military activities in the foreign EEZs” and the perception gap between the legal culture and the maritime dispute settlement mechanisms and what they imply for the South China Sea disputes are specific long-standing issues that need to be addressed by China and the United States. The land reclamation activities just add another keyword to this existing talk-show.

It is certainly not in China’s interest to be labeled a maritime coercer, nor in its interest to see formed a code of conduct that falls outside the framework of China-ASEAN centrality. An increasing U.S. military presence in the South China Sea, in the name of responding to maritime coercion, and an enhanced alliance between other claimant states and non-claimant states led by the United States in the name of taking cost-imposing measures does not line-up with China’s desire to solve the South China Sea issues through negotiations among the claimant states, be they bilateral or multilateral. What then is the best strategic choice for China?

At the February 2015 meeting of the United Nations Security Council, the Foreign Minister of China spelled out the elements which China subscribes to in the conduct of its foreign policy: peace and not conflict, cooperation and not confrontation, justice and not hegemony and a win-win and not a zero-sum approach. However, these ideas are easier said than done. The Chinese believe firmly in the above statement and principles. But how to deliver this message to the international community is an important, but challenging task. China’s image has been jeopardized by an international public relations campaign in which China has not done well enough in comparison to other claimant states (states which could easily win the moral high ground as smaller and weaker nations) in the long-standing territorial and maritime disputes in the South China Sea. Tremendous legal and diplomatic efforts are needed to achieve China’s strategic goal.

China could unlock the impasse in the South China by using soft power and diplomacy. In 2011, China announced a China-ASEAN Maritime Cooperation Fund, with a first paid-up capital of three-billion RMB (about $478,785 USD), primarily to support marine scientific research, connectivity and navigational safety in the South China Sea. In 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed to ASEAN that China would be willing to work together with ASEAN to build a “maritime silk road in the 21st century.” In 2014, China called for cooperation proposals from ASEAN states for the second round of competition for projects for the cooperation fund. China and ASEAN have also declared 2015 the “ASEAN-China Year of Maritime Cooperation.” There are two Chinese strategic considerations behind these concepts: to shape a new pattern of diplomatic relations with neighboring countries, and to create favorable conditions for better maritime cooperation, which in turn will create a benign environment so that China can build itself into a substantive maritime power.

As suggested by the above multilateral proposals, despite potential challenges, there is great hope for China and ASEAN to solve their differences in the South China Sea in their preferred ways. But for China and the United States, it is a different story.  Although the United States has expressed concern with China’s current land reclamation policy, it will do nothing that will undermine its bilateral relations. Washington may, however, upgrade its regional offensive capabilities (presence, operations, force structure, building partner capacity) beyond the strategic pivot policy if China continues its current approach in the Spratlys.

In order to resolve this paradox, China and the United States have no choice but to engage each other and maintain regular consultations on how they can coexist with their respective core interests. After all, the Asia Pacific is big enough for both countries to share and exert their respective influence without constantly being at each other’s throats. While China’s rise stands a good chance of triggering a regional power shift, the United States needs to acknowledge China’s rise and its core interests. Similarly, China must respect the legitimate interests of the United States in the South China Sea, especially freedom of navigation in line with UNCLOS, which in any case is also in China’s common interest. What would work practically in the favor of both countries is to explore the fields of developing maritime cooperation between China and the United States. Joint efforts in anti-piracy in the Gulf of Aden have provided one successful example. Providing search and rescue at sea and humanitarian assistance would be the areas for both countries to take a lead in this region with their naval capacity. It will be in China and the United States’ interests to initiate a regional mechanism in line with the safety and security of navigation, e.g. an Incidents at Sea Agreement (INCSEA) or a Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES) in this region.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>China’s Maritime Law Enforcement Reform and its Implication on the Regional Maritime Disputes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Chinese government announced in March 2013 its plan to centralize bureaucratic control over its maritime law enforcement agencies. Its decision to combine its separate maritime law enforcement bodies into an integrated one under the State Oceanic Administration (SOA), a part of the Ministry of Land and Natural Resources (MLR). China’s maritime law enforcement reform, implemented after years of debate on the country’s maritime enforcement capacity, has met with different responses within the country and from the region.

Suspicion within China arises from obstacles to bureaucratic reconciliation among formerly-separate agencies. There are also bifurcated reactions from the neighboring countries that have disputes with China on territorial and maritime jurisdiction. Some welcome this move because they believe that a united civilian maritime law enforcement agency will reduce the risk or conflict at sea. Others question whether a unified agency will allow China to be more assertive in pursuing its interests in the territorial and maritime disputes in the East and South China Sea.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organization Before the Reform:</span>

<a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Capture1.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2946" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Capture1.jpg" alt="Capture" width="600" height="271" /></a>

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organization After the Reform:</span>

<a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Post.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2947" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Post.jpg" alt="Post" width="600" height="252" /></a>

Four agencies are now slated for consolidation under the SOA: China Marine Surveillance (CMS, already under the SOA), Maritime Border Police (formerly under the Ministry of Public Security), the Fishing Regulation Administration (FRA, formerly under the Ministry of Agriculture) and General Administration of Customs (under the State Council). The fifth dragon, the Maritime Safety Administration, under the Ministry of Transport, in charge of navigational safety and search and rescue missions, is not listed in official statements on the merger. Sources in China suggest that the MSA strongly opposed the merger, making a strong case that it is also involved in supervising navigation in the numerous rivers in China. This objection aside, China sees the merger as crucial because its vessels are increasingly on the front lines of clashes between China and other states in the East and the South China Sea. The reform aims at enhancing China’s maritime law enforcement capacities in a more controlled and coordinated manner. Meanwhile, the reform could significantly improve response time, reduce redundancy, strengthen communication, and bolster overall <a href="http://www.jamestown.org/programs/chinabrief/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=40661&amp;cHash=c3c1a5a4ce04d29db680c8a092843afd#.VRvvqvx4rYg">command and control mechanisms</a>. Two objectives may be achieved through the merger: First, a unified force will better be able to pursue national objectives; second, it will reduce the chance that uncoordinated actions by separate commanders trigger unintended escalation and conflict at sea.

It is unclear, however, how fast these reform measures will be implemented and there are several organizational uncertainties. First, it appears that the new agency will be under the dual leadership of the SOA and Ministry of Public Security, which has traditionally exercised supervision of China’s border control forces. How this dual leadership will affect the operation of the new entity remains to be seen. Second, the restructure plan also calls for the establishment of a high-level consultation and coordinating body on maritime operations, named State Ocean Commission ( SOC). The composition and functions of SOC are still unclear. Whether this Commission will conflict or overlap with the Small Leadership Group is also an open question. Third, perhaps more importantly for the region, it is unclear whether the new agency will be equipped with heavy arms. The MBP, under the Ministry of Public Security, has always been armed. It is unclear whether all the boats of the new China maritime law enforcement agency will be armed. Fourth, it is also hard to predict whether the reform will be implemented without organizational obstacles from the former five dragons.

This new, integrated agency highlights the increasing importance of China’s Coast Guard, as distinct from its Navy. Coast guards and navies are mandated with different responsibilities. While navies have the mandate for the defence of a country, and its interests offshore, coast guards have the civilian mandate of marine safety and security. In some countries, the coast guard has the full spectrum of responsibilities which include marine safety and homeland security; others use mainly multi-tasking of their marine services through cooperation and coordination, but with strong government strategic direction and priorities. Despite the cooperating and coordinating nature between coast guards and navies, there is a fundamental cut of different missions between them. In maritime areas beyond national jurisdiction, such as high seas, only navies can legitimately exercise authority as flag states. In maritime areas within a national jurisdiction, such as a territorial sea, contiguous zone, or Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), both navies and coast guards can exercise their function, with different missions. What is distinct is the different impact in terms of pursuing national maritime interest. Naval involvement in an incident or crisis will raise concerns about the “use of force” or be perceived as escalatory, while coast guard or other civil maritime enforcement agencies will mitigate these concerns.

The important role that China’s civilian maritime agencies play has been demonstrated in the South China Sea and the East China Sea, through its engagements with the Philippines and Japan. During the Scarborough Shoals incident of 2012, observers will recall that China engaged the Philippines with two unarmed CMS vessels, despite the fact that the Philippines vessel was the Gregorio del Pilar, a naval warship. Some have charged that China’s strategy involves keeping its naval vessels “lurking in the background,” but it is important to remember that they were not introduced in this case.  Since 2012, China’s law enforcement vessels have also taken the lead in patrolling the contiguous zone and territorial waters of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, and the tempo of patrols has increased by both sides. There has also been an increased presence by military vessels from both China and Japan, but China’s CMS and FRA vessels take the lead in asserting its rights in the area.

There are at least three possible strategic and security implication derived from the ongoing structural reform of China’s maritime law enforcement. First, a united agency, now officially called China’s Coast Guard, reflects the decision of China’s leadership to enhance its maritime law enforcement capability and to transform it into a maritime power. China seems to believe that a civilian enforcement force serves to mitigate the conflict at sea and avoid direct military confrontation with other disputant states in the East China Sea and the South China Sea. The second major implication is that a stronger Chinese enforcement entity serves to promote China’s rapidly growing “soft power” both in the Asia-Pacific and around the globe. The third implication is the relationship between PLA Navy and the new China Coast Guard. The PLA Navy formerly had the capacity of only an elaborate coast guard and now emphasizes technology-intensive warfare. It shows interest in issues that are traditionally coast guards’ responsibility, including search and rescue, environmental protection, and piracy.

Coast guards appear to be part of the broader regional arms race. The Philippines Coast Guards has been expanding its capabilities for the last nine years. Japan has also built up the JCG, as a quasi-military force, and increased cooperation between military and civilian institutions. After China stepped up regular patrols of waters around the Diaoyu Islands following the September 2012 purchase, Japan increases the number of JCG vessels patrolling the islands from three to 30. Japanese politicians agree that the JCG needs to be “reinforced” fearing that its capability will be “overtaken by the Chinese”. On  October 26, 2012, the JCG received from government economic stimulus plan the largest ever disbursement of special funds, and the first specifically for territorial water patrol. This budget increases by 37 per cent for the financial year 2013 from the previous year. A dedicated “Senkaku Island team” was created aiming deploying ten new patrol boats to the area in the next three years.

In the East China Sea and the South China Sea, it is clear that none of the claimant states will compromise their national interest and find an easy solution to the existing territorial and maritime disputes. The growing possibility of clashes at sea is troubling, and it is urgent for all countries to make their domestic legislation on maritime law enforcement transparent and to increase the collective knowledge of each other’s domestic laws and regulations. China’s new unified Coast Guard and those of others in the region should be forces for peace, not triggers of conflict.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Japan is stepping up its law enforcement activities around the Senkaku Islands and is making that change public. Since 2012, Japan has had its Coast Guard assume a more active role in patrolling the Senkaku Islands, albeit without substantially increasing the overall budget. This comes in reponse to  increased Chinese incursions into the territorial waters and contiguous zones of the islands, which have spiked significantly since the Japanese government purchased three of the Senkaku Islands in 2012. By using the Coast Guard, Japan is able to at least partially address grey-zone security concerns while sidestepping mixed domestic sentiment about military activity and spending.

<iframe src="http://live.amcharts.com/mNDVm/embed/" width="600" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Despite tensions around the islands, the Japan Coast Guard’s budget has remained relatively steady over the last ten years. The pre-supplementary budget for FY2015 is only 4.8% higher than that of FY2006, though some funding has rolled over from the previous year’s supplementary budget. Internally, however, the Japan Coast Guard has reallocated funds for creating a Senkaku fleet and is resourcing shipbuilding and doctrinal changes to match. The FY2015 draft budget requests 187.6 billion JPY, with the lion’s share going toward reinforcing fleet strength and staffing, including building six new PL (Patrol vessel Large)-class ships for Senkaku patrols.

The new fleet dedicated to Senkaku patrols will consist of a total of 12 patrol vessels, including four patrol vessels that were already built at the Ishigaki Coast Guard Office in FY2014 (PL81 Taketomi, PL82 Nagura, PL83 Kabira, PL84 Zanki), and two existing PLH (Patrol vessel Large with Helicopter)-class patrol vessels from the 11th Regional Coast Guard Headquarters. Meanwhile, the six new PL-class ships will have an overall length of 96 meters (314ft), a displacement of 1,500GT, and will have a helicopter landing pad. The Japan Coast Guard has also introduced a new crew rotation system to some of the new PL-class patrol vessels in order to increase their operational capacity and availability. This comes alongside a request for 435 new employees, including 263 “strategic reinforcements” and 172 individuals for new mission requirements and maritime challenge response. If the budget is approved by the Diet, the total number of Japan Coast Guard personnel will be 13,422. The investment in new capabilities is undeniable. At the commissioning of the PL81 Taketomi and PL82 Nagura last year, Admiral Yuji Sato, Commandant of the Japan Coast Guard, noted that “this is one of the largest-ever investments in the 66-year Japan Coast Guard history.”

The new JCG budget also provides for increased operational flexibility in Senkaku contingencies, for instance, by setting up nationwide response systems for increased activity around the islands. Outside of the Senkaku fleet, the Japan Coast Guard will fund an additional six new PL class patrol vessels (FY2016), six new PM (Patrol vessel Medium)-class patrol vessels (FY2016, FY2017) and life extension or upgrades for two PLH class patrol vessels (FY2015). Moreover, it includes the procurement of new long-range high-speed jet aircraft with sophisticated surveillance systems to enhance monitoring capabilities.

<strong>Source: <a href="http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/page23e_000021.html">Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan</a></strong>

Despite this growth, however, there is little doubt that China’s presence in the East China Sea remains a challenge for the JCG. From January of 2008 to January of 2012, there were a total of 65 incursions by Chinese vessels into the Senkaku Islands’ territorial waters. In September of 2014 alone, the two year anniversary of the islands’ acquisition, there were 120 recorded incidents. While many of these incidents involve Chinese hulls slipping briefly across the line and then withdrawing, no matter how small the incursion, the Japan Coast Guard is obligated to respond and escort the intruders out. This poses an operational challenge for Japan’s maritime service. In addition to the challenges posed by Beijing’s incursions, in March 2013, China <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2013npc/2013-03/11/content_16296448.htm">unified</a> maritime law enforcement agencies under the umbrella of the State Oceanic Administration, creating a single Coast Guard force. This unified force is better resourced than its predecessors. Later this year China will deploy a Coast Guard ship with more than 10,000 tons of displacement. With a better equipped, more aggressive Chinese Coast Guard encroaching on its territory, Japan feels it must respond.

On March 13, 2015, the FY2015 budget passed Japan’s House of Representatives. Discussion continues within the House of Councilors, however the budget will be approved automatically on April 11, even if the Upper House fails to reach a decision. It is likely the new Senkaku fleet will be assembled and deployed. Some might argue that the larger law enforcement footprint increases the risk of a security incident between the two Coast Guards. In fact, communications and confidence between the two Coast Guards are at an all-time high. The Japanese and Chinese Coast Guards, perhaps by virtue of working in such close proximity, share a close, professional relationship built on cooperative Search and Rescue activities, commandant meetings, and exceptional levels of experience reading signals from one another. When looking at the activities of Coast Guards operating in sensitive waters, it is important to remember that these are professional forces with great experience and training.

Even though the two services have experience operating together, however, the Chinese incursions in Japanese territorial water continue to cause strains. Any interaction between the two services has the potential for escalation. The greatest risk, however, is probably not the interactions of these two maritime services, but the potential for some unexpected event.  As we saw in 2010, all it takes is a <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a09e651a-bb04-11df-9e1d-00144feab49a.html#axzz3VVrbthz4">wayward fishing boat</a> to create ripples throughout Asia.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On March 17th at the Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition in Malaysia, Vice Admiral Robert Thomas, commander of the US 7<sup>th</sup> Fleet, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-18/u-s-navy-urges-joint-southeast-asia-patrols-of-south-china-sea">proposed the creation of joint maritime patrols</a> in the South China Sea by ASEAN member nations. The remarks engendered a mixed reaction, from the predictably negative <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-03/20/c_134084730.htm">Chinese Foreign Ministry response</a> to the equally predictable <a href="http://www.angmalaya.net/nation/2015/03/19/9662-philippine-navy-supports-joint-patrolling-of-south-china-sea-with-us-asean-navies">embrace by the Philippines Navy</a>. While some responses focused on the challenges facing such a project, few paid attention to how the United States could support the endeavor.

Undoubtedly, joint patrols would need to overcome political hurdles. The most significant obstacle is the difficulty of defining a common objective among potential patrol participants. A counter-piracy mission would be the least contentious, mitigating some of the sovereignty and jurisdictional issues between South China Sea claimants. It would also allow planners to draw from recent cooperative counter-piracy experiences near the Horn of Africa and Strait of Malacca. Sovereignty issues would be harder surmount with respect to fishing enforcement missions. Such missions, however, would provide the patrols with more work on a daily basis and might therefore be billed as the more cost-effective choice.

Yet, while either mission could serve as the ostensible remit of the patrols, the real purpose of Vice Admiral Thomas’ proposal appeared to be boosting both the presence of and interoperability between the claimant navies for the sake of deterrence and cooperation. As a result, Richard Bitzinger, a senior fellow at Singapore’s Rajaratnam School of International Studies, correctly told Bloomberg News that “above all you need a common threat perception” to bring claimants on board.

Additional challenges abound, from the interoperability “nightmare” raised by Bitzinger, to the lack of “common communications equipment and intelligence-sharing agreements” among the states. But a <a href="http://cimsec.org/part-2-whither-pmscs-south-southeast-asia/10912">history of regional joint patrols and information sharing mechanisms</a> including the Malacca Straits Patrol (MSP) Network and the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) suggests they can be tackled.

What role would the United States play in such an arrangement? According to Bloomberg, Vice Admiral Thomas went on at the panel to say that “if ASEAN members were to take the lead… trust me, the U.S. 7th Fleet would be ready to support.” Direct support would likely come in the form of Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) assistance, primarily intelligence on vessels gathered and shared by U.S. assets such as its satellites and fleet of maritime patrol aircraft. In this effort the United States might be joined by Japan, which <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/us-japan-to-boost-asean-maritime-security/">has stated</a> its desire to aid the development of ASEAN nations’ MDA capabilities and <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-04/japan-to-consider-expanding-navy-patrols-to-south-china-sea">recently mooted</a> its own prospects for South China Sea patrols. In addition to MDA, the U.S. Navy could provide counter-piracy training, logistics, and organizational support. Finally, the U.S. Navy might also directly join the joint patrol efforts. <a href="http://www.navy.mil/ah_online/LCS/index.html">One of the advantages</a> the U.S. Navy touts for its Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), fast becoming a fixture in the Western Pacific with four to be forward-stationed in Singapore, is its suitability for Theater Security Cooperation (TSC) as it can act as a peer with partner nations given its small stature.

Direct U.S. Navy participation in patrols could carry drawbacks, however. Nations might be unwilling to sign on for what could be taken as an overt provocation of China by ‘siding’ with the U.S. Navy, or simply because it brought in external military forces. The United States-proposed 2004 Regional Maritime Security Initiative, which was aimed at piracy and terrorism and would have included naval vessels, marines, and special forces, was rejected by Indonesia and Malaysia in large part due to the militarized nature of the potential American support. Further, if the mission chosen for the patrols was fisheries enforcement, the U.S. Navy would have little expertise or experience to contribute. And if required to deal directly with “<a href="http://cimsec.org/feast-cabbage-salami-part-vocabulary-asian-maritime-disputes/13441">cabbage strategy</a>” incursions of fishermen and civilian maritime agencies, a navy could be a liability in the ensuing public relations battle.

A more natural to fit would be the “white hulls” of the U.S. Coast Guard, which could mitigate many of the drawbacks listed above. Yet, a look at the U.S. Coast Guard’s ability to support the project highlights the stretched resources of the agency in the region. The <a href="http://www.uscg.mil/d14/sectguam/units.asp">closest stationed forces</a> are those assigned to Coast Guard District 14, Sector Guam: two small 110ft <em>Island</em>-class cutters and a buoy tender. These frankly have their hands full patrolling the waters of Guam, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana's Islands, The Republic of Palau, and the Federated States of Micronesia that together account for 43% of the United States’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

To compensate for the lack of regional organic assets, the U.S. Coast Guard occasionally sends vessels home-ported elsewhere through the region, as in 2012 when the USCGC <em>Waesche</em> National Security Cutter participated in the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) exercise. The ‘Indo-Asia-Pacific’ section of the just released revision to the U.S. sea services’ <a href="http://www.navy.mil/local/maritime/150227-CS21R-Final.pdf"><em>A Cooperative Strategy for 21<sup>st</sup> Century Seapower</em></a> (CS-21R) supports this approach, stating “the Coast Guard will rotationally deploy National Security Cutters and deployable specialized forces with the Navy and Marine Corps to safeguard U.S. territorial waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).”

For now, however, the cutter rotations are mostly aspirational and likely to remain a low priority. The Commandant of the Coast Guard <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?323836-1/admiral-paul-zukunft-role-coast-guard">noted in January</a> that “As the Navy repositions to the Pacific, I’m repositioning to the Western Hemisphere.” In fact, a DoD program known as the <a href="https://www.dvidshub.net/news/88776/coast-guard-navy-partner-oceania-maritime-security-initiative#.VRh3tfnF8qs">Oceania Maritime Security Initiative</a> (OMSI) attempts to fill the shortfall by using transiting naval assets to aid the Coast Guard’s missions in the region. Navy ships and aircraft boost the Coast Guard’s MDA. The ships also play host to Coast Guard’s Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDETs), allowing them to conduct interdictions and boardings of vessels of interest.

While U.S. Coast Guard vessels and aircraft may be hard pressed to support joint patrols in the South China Sea, the LEDETs mentioned above indicate a strength of the Coast Guard that could be further utilized in region. Retired USCG Cdr. Charles Hill notes their experience expands beyond Navy-Coast Guard cooperation, as they work “joint operations with other nations, including China on a regular basis. In most cases it is LEDETs riding ships of other nations with law enforcement authority.” CS-21R also endorses the role of LEDET ship riders in the Indo-Asia-Pacific section. It states that “the Coast Guard will work with regional partners and navies using joint and combined patrols, ship-rider exchanges, and multinational exercises to build proficient maritime governance forces, enhance cooperation in maritime safety and security, and reduce illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.” Whether the mission of South China Sea joint patrols was fisheries enforcement or counter-piracy, LEDETs of the <a href="http://www.uscg.mil/pacarea/pactaclet/arriving_members.asp">Pacific Tactical Law Enforcement Team</a> out of San Diego would have a strong case to represent U.S. support through training and operations.

The spirit of ASEAN cooperation and enthusiasm for joint operations may find a readier home with other projects. The <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/malaysia-plans-peacekeeping-force-for-south-china-sea-1426687959">Wall Street Journal</a> reports that Malaysia’s Defense Minister earlier this month proposed the creation of a joint peacekeeping force for regional conflict spots. Meanwhile to the South China Sea’s southeast, Malaysia is working towards joint patrols of the Sulu Sea in replication of the MSP and to forestall the sort of <a href="http://news.usni.org/2013/03/06/borneo-violence-escalates">violence seen in 2013</a> with the invasion of Borneo by the ‘Sultan of Sulu.’]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With revelations of China’s systematic and rapid reclamation or “island-building” of various features throughout the South China Sea, long-simmering dispute in the South China Sea seem closer to boiling over. <em>Terriclaims</em>, short for territorial reclamation, is a term that is useful for describing a nation’s reclamation activities when it seeks to preserve or expand territory as part of a broader geopolitical ambition. States have reclaimed land for millennia, but no nation has sought to do so as far away from its own national boundaries as China. Moreover, the clandestine manner which China is undertaking these activities in the South China Sea is cause for concern.

To understand why China’s <em>terriclaims </em>are unusual, it is useful to consider some other state’ building projects. China is <em>not building</em> a Palm or World Islands, like the Emirati city of Dubai. Dubai’s multi-billion dollar reclamation project begun in 2001 envisions multiple archipelagos that emanate from the Emirati coast into the Persian Gulf. <em>Palm Jumeirah</em>, the most recent archipelago completed in 2006 and configured in the shape of a palm, includes luxury homes, various resorts, and a monorail spread over miles of newly reclaimed land.

Rather, it appears that China’s building projects are part of an expansive territorial grab or to make China’s disputed Nine-Dash Line claim a reality. These <em>terriclaims</em> seem to be China’s latest attempt at a slow and methodical encroachment tactic to assert control over the SCS, a policy pejoratively referred to as “salami-slicing.” While China’s activities in the Spratlys may have only grabbed international attention recently, its use of this tactic is hardly novel.

<a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/asia_programs_blankte.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3047" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/asia_programs_blankte.jpg" alt="asia_programs_blankte" width="591" height="437" /></a>

<strong>Reclamation in Chinese History </strong>

<em>Terriclaims</em> are a novel attempt by China to reset maritime boundaries in the South China Sea, but their emergence should not take observers by entirely by surprise. This is because <em>terriclaims</em> are the latest incarnation of a long history of reclamation in China, which has traditionally been resourced and supported at all levels of Chinese government. China has a legacy of reclamation dating back to the 5<sup>th</sup> century B.C., when it used dredging and reclamation techniques to construct the Grand Canal. The ancient and Venice-like city of Suzhou was built on reclaimed land.  In modern times, China has reclaimed massive parts of Macao, Shanghai, and even use reclamation in the recent expansion of Hong Kong International Airport. Additionally, reclamation activities have been woven into Beijing’s national governance and responsibility for reclamation activities has been diffused to all levels of government. Indeed, the Chinese bureaucracy has four major organizations that handle one or more aspects of reclamation issues: the Ministry of Land Resources, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Environmental Protection, and the State Oceanic Administration.

The political placement and maritime-focus of the State Oceanic Administration (guójiāhǎiyángjú 国家海洋局), under Minister Liu Cigu, make it unique out of these four. The SOA held the leadership role in reorganizing most of China’s maritime civilian and paramilitary organizations in 2013. This coincides with the creation in 2012 of a new, high-level advisory group for maritime security issues by the Politburo Standing Committee, whose first leader was Xi Jinping. The evidence suggests that the SOA is leading the <em>terriclaim</em> efforts under direction from the highest levels in Beijing.

China is also <a href="http://csis.org/files/publication/140930_Hiebert_PerspectivesSouthChinaSea_Web.pdf">not the first state to use reclamation</a> to the South China Sea. In 1999, Malaysia constructed a two-story concrete building on Investigator Shoal (midway between the Philippines and Malaysia) along with a helipad, radar station, and pier. Taiwan carried out major reclamation projects on Pratas Island in 2007. China terraformed Woody Island in the Paracel Islands to include a 7,900-foot runway, three ports, and PLA Navy and Air force assets. However, China not only appears to be protecting its claims but expanding upon them with these new massive <em>terriclaim</em> projects that have a uniquely military bent. The progression of these <em>terriclaims</em>’ point to the construction of airstrips, hardened facilities, storage centers, staging areas, and deep-draft channels for shipping. Enhanced civilian communication infrastructure, scientific research stations, or fishing support facilities would require neither such a large footprint nor the sense of urgency and secrecy in their construction. China watchers, such as Japan’s Yoji Koda, contend that potential reclamation (<em>terriclaim</em>) efforts on Scarborough Shoal alone <a href="http://csis.org/files/attachments/140807_Koda.pdf">could potentially create an island</a> that contains multiple square miles of new land.

<a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/VD2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3048" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/VD2.jpg" alt="VD2" width="566" height="358" /></a>

<strong>Global Repercussions</strong>

China’s <em>terriclaims</em> may have significant second and third order effects. <em>Terriclaims</em>, if sanctioned by the other SCS claimants, ASEAN, or the broader international community, could result in significant maritime territorial loss if a <em>terriclaim</em> is legitimized. This could also lead to conflict. The South China Sea has seen conflict over territory in the past, but China’s capabilities and global clout have grown substantially. At the same time, this tactic need not be limited to the South China Sea, and may be used in other vulnerable littoral areas. There are more than 150 littoral countries that claim over 36 percent of the world’s maritime domain. The low-lying, littoral nations in the Caribbean Sea, Baltic Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Persian Gulf, Oceania, and Arctic are all susceptible to <em>terriclaiming</em>. The low-water depths and close proximity of other littoral nations in these contiguous resource-rich coastal zones make <em>terriclaiming</em> possible and, perhaps, desirable. Additionally, the 1982 <a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338703-unclos-e.html">United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)</a>, has no provisions to account for <em>terriclaims</em>. The provisions that could be interpreted to challenge or support <em>terriclaims</em> within UNCLOS are ambiguous at best.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>

Regardless of UNCLOS’s relative silence on these issues, <em>terriclaims</em> need to be addressed. If China’s <em>terriclaims</em> are legitimized by the international community’s inaction, this would not only reward Beijing’s behavior, but also give the Chinese carte blanche to continue <em>terriclaiming</em> in other areas. More importantly, sanctioning <em>terriclaims</em> would encourage other states to follow China’s lead. If a solution is not found, <em>terriclaims</em> will wreak havoc on the maritime environment and its frameworks. At the very least, the perceived military bent of China’s <em>terriclaims</em> will continue to unnerve other claimants.

<strong><em>Terriclaims</em></strong><strong> in the Future</strong>

Unless the legal ambiguity is removed or China’s <em>terriclaims</em> are directly challenged, a <em>terriclaims</em>-race could ensue between China and the other claimants. There are two possible responses the international community should consider.  First, signatory states could revise UNCLOS to account for <em>terriclaims </em>or attach an addendum agreement similar to the 1995 Fish and Stock Agreement. Yet, a far-reaching revision or addendum of UNCLOS is unlikely. In order for a revision to occur, Beijing’s support would undoubtedly be required as a member of the Security Council and the regional leader. Second, interested states could quash <em>terriclaims</em> through arbitration in either International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) or the International Court of Justice or through a broader framework or agreement. Conversely, litigation and arbitration may not necessarily be a feasible solution either considering the current lengthy and drawn-out legal battle between the Philippines and China. Depending how the litigation proceeds, it may be more likely that the parties will fall back on some form of bilateral or multilateral agreement, similar but more robust than the 2002 Declaration on Conduct, that seeks rapprochement over the <em>terriclaims</em> between ASEAN or ASEAN-member claimants and China.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>

China’s <em>terriclaims</em> manifest the great lengths to which China is willing to go to dominate the South China Sea. And despite its seeming novelty, the fact that this tactic has such a longstanding role in Chinese history means that we should not expect to see it disappear from Beijing’s toolkit any time soon.

		<title>How Will China View the New Maritime Strategy?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The military services responsible for American seapower (Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard) recently released their new maritime strategy, entitled <a href="http://www.navy.mil/local/maritime/150227-CS21R-Final.pdf">“Forward, Engaged, Ready: A Cooperative Strategy for 21<sup>st</sup> Century Seapower.”</a>  The reviews thus far have been positive, with most analysts praising the specificity of the document, <a href="http://www.navy.mil/maritime/MaritimeStrategy.pdf">as compared to its 2007 predecessor</a>, as well as its harder, more combat-oriented edge.  One set of reviewers have yet to be heard from, however, and that is the large and garrulous community of Chinese military analysts.  This analysis attempts to anticipate what that reaction will be.

One of indication of how the Chinese military community will react is its past history.  The 2007 strategy did not name China as a challenge or threat, nor did it particularly focus on Chinese strategies already being discussed in navalist circles for denying U.S. freedom of action.  As the Team Lead for the production of that document, I was privy to high level conversations about the degree to which the document should “name names.”  One discussion in particular occurred late in the development of the strategy, in which the then-Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Mike Mullen reacted to the insistence of another Navy four-star admiral that China should be explicitly identified in that document.  Mullen’s reaction was that he believed they (the Chinese) would “read themselves into the document.”

Within weeks of the October 2007 release of the strategy, Dr. Andrew Erickson of the China Maritime Studies Institute based at the U.S. Naval War College <a href="https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/21380430-28cf-4a54-afbb-cb1f64761b27/Assessing-the-New-U-S--Maritime-Strategy--A-Window.aspx">began to survey Chinese open source discussions</a>, and his work largely confirmed Admiral Mullen’s prediction.  The strategy advanced an argument about the defense of the global system and this was clearly understood by Chinese analysts as meaning that the United States would defend the system it had designed and led.  Additionally, they understood that the strategy intended to help the United States retain its global leadership position.  None of these points were particularly appealing to Chinese analysts, even if the message itself was rather nuanced.

The new maritime strategy dispenses with subtlety.  No longer espousing the defense of the global system as its strategic kernel, the new strategy moves down the strategic continuum from its predecessor’s more “grand” aspirations, to strategy more focused on the operational benefits of American seapower, chief among them, the ability to gain and maintain access to enable joint operations.  This focus on access is a direct result of China’s counter-intervention strategy known largely in the United States as “anti-access and area denial” (A2/AD). To a lesser extent, Iran is also pursuing similar capabilities and concepts.  The naval services rightly understand that the United States’ competitive advantage is its ability to project power thousands of miles from its own shores, In order to mitigate that advantage,  China recognizes that it must deny it the free use of the seas.  Unlike its predecessor, this document names names.

The new strategy also underscores another great strength of the U.S. strategic approach in the Indo-Asia Pacific: its network of friends and allies. The document states: “[b]ased on shared strategic interests, the United States seeks to strengthen cooperation with long-standing allies in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region—Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, and Thailand—and continues to cultivate partnerships with states such as Bangladesh, Brunei, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Micronesia, Pakistan, Singapore, and Vietnam.”  Where Washington speaks of strengthening partnerships, the Chinese are sure to see encirclement, and they will not be bashful about saying so.  Some analysts saw the far less China-focused 2007 document as a modern statement of containment; this version is likely to evoke even more hyperbolic responses.

Beijing’s perception of encirclement will be evoked as a justification for both the build-up and modernization of naval forces and the continuing importance of the Chinese counter-intervention strategy.  Additionally, there may be attempts to justify extending the Chinese network of bases and places to locations much closer to the United States than ongoing efforts in West Asia and Africa, including initiatives in South America and the Caribbean.

China’s centrality in this document is, however, also likely to have the perverse effect of stroking the collective ego of analysts with the “Century of Humiliation” chip on their shoulders.  At least some Chinese military analysts and opinion writers are sure to see this new strategy as reinforcing their own growing sense of major power self-esteem.

Finally, though it is unlikely we will see much <em>public</em> discussion along these lines, it should be obvious to the Chinese that the United States does not wish to quietly fade into the night, and that there is plenty of thought and resources being applied to ensuring naval dominance in the Indo-Asia Pacific region for decades to come.  China may have previously been able to quietly “fly under the radar,” but that time is past.  A competition is on, and both sides are now acknowledging it. There is far less room for nuance now.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Promoting Good Faith in the South China Sea</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As China continues its reclamation activities in the South China Sea, there is <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/02/is-there-a-silver-lining-to-chinas-south-china-sea-land-reclamation/">speculation</a> that it will use the new land masses to justify its international legal claims. One critical question will be whether it claims an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) for each of the features being developed.  Given China’s <a href="http://chinesejil.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/1/9.abstract">interpretation</a> of the rights of other states in its EEZ, this step would be worrisome for those that are committed to freedom of the seas.  But, as examined below, China has already taken the position that artificial improvements will not change the legal status of land features.  The question now is whether China will demonstrate good faith and remain consistent in its position – something it has come to expect of other states.

Good faith is accepted as a <a href="http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/files/dmfile/downloadb3081.pdf">general principle of international law</a> that is rooted in <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/78/6761.pdf">equity</a>, fairness, and consistency.  Among other sources, the requirement for states to act in good faith can be found in the <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/ctc/uncharter.pdf">United Nations Charter</a>, the <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201155/volume-1155-I-18232-English.pdf">Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</a>, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (<a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part16.htm">UNCLOS</a>),  and the <a href="http://www.un-documents.net/a25r2625.htm">Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-Operation Among States</a>.  To quote the latter, “[e]very state has the duty to fulfill in good faith its obligations under international agreements valid under the generally recognized principles and rules of international law.”  In practice, and somewhat controversially, the principle of good faith has been applied beyond the treaty-realm to conclude that a State’s <a href="http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_9_2006.pdf">unilateral declarations</a> can create binding obligations under international law.  For instance, in the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/59/6159.pdf">Nuclear Tests Case</a>, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) relied on the principle of good faith in reasoning that unilateral political declarations could have binding effect in certain circumstances.

Only a few months ago, China invoked the ICJ’s reasoning while advocating for consistency in state positions in the South China Sea disputes.  In fact, in its <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1217147.shtml">position paper</a> on the Philippines arbitration case, China went so far as to argue that the Philippines had violated the principle of good faith by making inconsistent political statements.  Citing the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/59/6159.pdf">Nuclear Tests Case</a>, China embraced an expansive interpretation of the principle in arguing that the Philippines had breached  its obligation to act in good faith by, on the one hand, ignoring the call in the <a href="http://www.asean.org/asean/external-relations/china/item/declaration-on-the-conduct-of-parties-in-the-south-china-sea">Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC)</a> for negotiated dispute resolution by initiating arbitration while, on the other hand, pressing for full implementation of the DOC.  China argued that in taking these two positions at once, the Philippines had fallen short of its obligation to act in good faith, an obligation China interprets as “requir[ing] all States to honestly interpret agreements they enter into with others, not to misinterpret them in disregard of their authentic meaning in order to obtain an unfair advantage.”

In March, China again <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/03/china-slams-philippines-for-south-china-sea-hypocrisy/">condemned</a> what it perceives as political inconsistencies by the Philippines, this time regarding construction activities in the South China Sea. It has similarly faulted other states for assuming inconsistent positions with respect to their sovereignty claims.  For instance, <a href="http://www.china-un.org/eng/hyyfy/t1165598.htm">addressing</a> the state parties to UNCLOS last June, China's Ambassador to the United Nations argued that Vietnam's claim to the Paracel Islands contradicted earlier Vietnamese declarations on the sovereignty of the islands.  The Ambassador referenced the doctrine of <a href="http://epublications.bond.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1362&amp;context=blr">estoppel</a>, an equitable principle rooted in good faith that acts to bar parties to a dispute from changing positions to the detriment of their opponent, suggesting that Vietnam could no longer be trusted in international relations.  According to the Ambassador, "trustworthiness is of paramount importance in state-to-state relations."

By introducing the principle of good faith as a substantive obligation applicable to the interaction of states in the South China Sea, China has invited the same scrutiny from states wishing to challenge future Chinese claims as inconsistent with its own positions in the past.  Which brings us to China’s position on Okinotori Island, a feature in the East China Sea.  Readers may recall that, in <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/jpn08/chn_6feb09_e.pdf">2009</a> and again in <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/jpn08/chn_3aug11_e.pdf">2011</a>, China formally challenged Japan’s inclusion of Okinotori in its submission before the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS).  China’s primary contention was that Okinotori was a “rock” under Article 121 of UNCLOS and, thus, not entitled to a continental shelf or an EEZ.  In making its argument, China emphasized that Okinotori could not sustain life “on its natural conditions.”  This statement was a reference to Japan’s <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/ephemeral-islands/">substantial efforts</a> to artificially fortify Okinotori so as to prevent its erosion.  To the Chinese, this represented an impermissible effort to change the facts on the ground and prompted the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s <a href="http://archives.pireport.org/archive/2010/February/02-12-ft.htm">admonition</a> that “the construction of infrastructure will not change Okinotori Reef’s legal position.”

While the question of whether a feature is a rock or an island is outside the mandate of the CLCS, the Commission took note of China’s argument and <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N12/326/32/PDF/N1232632.pdf?OpenElement">deferred</a> ruling on Okinotori’s right to a continental shelf.  China <a href="http://zanzibar.chineseconsulate.org/eng/fyrth/t933024.htm">hailed</a> this determination as “fair and reasonable” and stated that the Commission had “safeguarded the overall interest of the international community.”

There is no doubt that China perceived its position on EEZs and uninhabitable rocks to be advantageous in regards to Okinotori, but it may prove to be an inconvenient precedent for possible land-based claims in the South China Sea.  Just as it had criticized Japan for doing, China is today engaged in construction of infrastructure on what may be similarly uninhabitable features.  The prospect of future EEZ claims arising from this construction exposes a dramatic inconsistency with China’s earlier opposition at Okinotori and, despite challenging states to respect the principle of good faith, substantially detracts from the <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/paul-pillar/why-nations-including-the-usand-iran-comply-their-agreements-12434">predictability</a> in state-state relations that good faith ought to produce.

China’s call for consistency and adherence to international legal principles in the region is positive, but leading by example would be far more effective.  China should clarify the intent of its reclamation activities in the South China Sea and reaffirm its position that maritime claims <a href="http://www.rsis.edu.sg/rsis-publication/rsis/co14213-large-scale-reclamation-projects-in-the-south-china-sea-china-and-international-law/">cannot be perfected</a> through human development of otherwise uninhabitable features.  These are steps that China can itself take to promote good faith and “safeguard the overall interest of the international community.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Philippines and the United States will hold a large-scale 10-day military exercise known as <em>Balikatan</em> (Shoulder-to-Shoulder) from April 20-30. This takes place in the face of China’s island-building activities in the South China Sea.  For <em>Balikatan</em> 2015, 11,740 American, Filipino, and Australian troops will conduct joint training exercises and maneuvers in three separate locations in the Philippines.  This is twice the number of the Filipino and American troops who participated in last year’s <em>Balikatan</em> exercise.  The United States will also deploy at least 75 aircraft and three warships.  The Philippines will send 15 aircraft and one ship; Australia will bring one transport plane.  <em>Balikatan</em> 2015 will include joint training in territorial defense, humanitarian assistance, and disaster response.  There will also be a Command Post Exercise (CPX) event that will focus on Maritime Security (MARSEC) with a Combined Arms Lived Fire Exercise to test the capacity of the Armed Forces of the Philippines’s (AFP’s) newly formed National Maneuver Forces.  These drills are significant because the Philippines has traditionally relied heavily on the U.S. for its territorial defense requirements, given its limited conventional military capabilities.

<em>Balikatan </em>2015 is the 31<sup>st</sup> bilateral military exercise between the two allies, who are partners in the 1951 Philippine-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty.  It is the most comprehensive among the annual regular joint military exercises conducted by the two allies as it is designed to develop the AFP’s combat readiness in territorial defense, and to enhance the two armed forces’ interoperability.  The AFP has described this year’s exercise as an expanded <em>Balikatan </em>given the 100 percent increase in the number of troops involved, and the conduct of live-fire trainings that will be staged by the two allies close to the South China Sea.  The United States is sending 6,000 troops to the Philippines, more than double the 2,599 American servicemen who took part in last year’s exercise. U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps units will train alongside their Filipino counterparts.   Elements of the Okinawa-based III Marine Expeditionary Force will conduct beach training maneuvers on the main island of Luzon.  American forces will operate from the Clark Air Field, formerly a U.S Air Force base in the Philippines, while a combined lived-fire exercise will be held in another former American military facility--Crow Valley Gunnery Range.  Some joint exercises will be held along the west coast of the main island of Luzon, and in the western coastal areas of the province of Palawan, both areas facing the South China Sea.  Notably, some of the events will also be held at the Zambales Naval Base in Luzon, which is located only 137 miles east of the Chinese-controlled Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea.

During press briefings, the Philippine military spokesperson denied that the expansion of the annual war game was directed against China. This seems improbable, given the number of troops that will be involved in the expanded war games and the fact that some of the events will be in coastal areas facing the South China Sea.  Moreover, commentators and analysts cannot help but link the expanded <em>Balikatan</em> 2015 with the Chinese island-building in the South China Sea in the light of increasing American criticism of these activities. American military officials and top political leaders have criticized China’s building activities by pointing out that this construction is decreasing the chances of a peaceful resolution of the South China Sea dispute.  In late March 2015, the Commander of the United States Pacific Fleet, Admiral Harry Harris, accused China of “<a href="http://www.pressreader.com/australia/the-sydney-morning-herald/20150401/281487864854356/TextView">creating a great wall of sand with dredgers and bulldozers</a>” in the Spratlys.  During his trip to Japan early this month, U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter declared that the “<a href="http://english.cntv.cn/2015/04/08/VIDE1428493094514639.shtml">United States has long opposed that kind of activity</a>” (island construction) and that the United States would continue to watch these developments “<a href="http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0002063898">closely</a>.”

The strongest criticism of China’s island construction activities was voiced out by no less than U.S. President Barack Obama himself.   During a town hall meeting in Jamaica, President Obama criticized China’s recent building activities the South China Sea.   He also admitted that his administration is concerned with China as it is “<a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/04/10/usa-obama-china-idINKBN0N02HZ20150410">not necessarily abiding by international norms and rules, and using its size and muscle to force countries into subordinate positions</a>.”  He then warned China not to “elbow aside” smaller countries like the Philippines and Vietnam in its conflict over territories in the South China Sea dispute.  By increasing the number of American troops in <em>Balikatan</em> 2015, the Obama Administration seems to be sending a not-so-subtle message to China that its rapid building efforts will not undermine longstanding alliances.

		<title>On the Defensive? China Explains Purposes of Land Reclamation in the South China Sea</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Growing international criticism of China’s land reclamation in the South China Sea and the publication of detailed images of China’s dredging and construction activities prompted the Chinese government to explain in greater detail than ever before the purpose of these activities. In response to U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter’s charge that China has “intensified the militarization in the islands and reefs in the South China Sea and escalated regional tension,” and the release of a series of satellite photos by CSIS of recent dredging and construction activities on Mischief Reef, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Chunying issued a lengthy statement on April 9. In addition to repeating prior positions that China has “indisputable sovereignty” over the Spratly Islands and adjacent waters, and that China’s construction is “fair, reasonable, and lawful,” Hua stated that China’s activities are <em>mainly </em>for civilian purposes, but also are intended to serve “necessary military defense requirements.”

That is the first time that the Chinese government has officially acknowledged that its land reclamation activity is intended at least in part for military purposes. On September 9, 2014, when Hua Chunying was asked explicitly whether China’s large-scale reclamation work was intended for commercial or military use, she responded “As far as I know, the construction work China is undertaking on relevant islands is mainly for the purpose of improving the working and living conditions of people stationed on these islands.” On November 24, Hua made the same claim, adding that by improving the conditions for the island-stationed personnel, they can better fulfill their international obligations and responsibilities in search and rescue.

In the April 9 statement, in addition to acknowledging that China plans to use the outposts for unstated military missions, Hua also provided greater detail about the civilian purposes that the islands will serve. She maintained that China seeks to improve relevant functions the islands and reefs provide, to better safeguard national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, to better meet China’s international responsibilities and obligations in maritime search and rescue, disaster prevention and mitigation, marine scientific research, weather observation, environmental protection, navigation safety, fishery production services, and other areas.

Hua added that the civilian facilities would provide services to China and its neighboring countries, as well as international vessels sailing in the South China Sea.

In other words, the Chinese are now attempting to assuage concerns about their artificial island building by claiming that these activities are aimed at providing public goods. Chinese researchers are also making this argument. For example, PLA Navy Rear Admiral Yin Zhuo wrote in an article published by China News Agency on March 8 that large scale radar stations are needed in the South China Sea for communication and monitoring. Citing the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, Yin Zhuo argued for enhanced search and rescue capabilities to respond to possible sea and air accidents. China, he said, has “undisputed responsibility” for maritime search and rescue in the South China Sea based on an International Maritime Organization (IMO) determination in 1985 that “China and Chinese Hong Kong are responsible for the region north of 10 degrees north latitude and west of 124 degrees east longitude.”

Likely in response to accusations by the Philippines that China’s dredging is causing catastrophic damage to the coral reefs, Hua insisted that China had undertaken “scientific assessments and rigorous tests” to ensure that “the ecology of the South China Sea will not be damaged.” That China’s foreign ministry spokesman felt compelled to make this statement suggests that Beijing is at least somewhat concerned that it not be seen as harming the environment. This may be a useful pressure point for the international community going forward. ASEAN might consider asking the Chinese to share their environmental impact studies.

China’s transparency, albeit limited, about its intentions should be welcome and be used as an opportunity to press for additional information as well as reassurance.  China should be urged to match the information it has provided on the potential civilian purposes of its land reclamation activities with similar details about the military functions its garrisons will serve. CSIS’ Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative has confirmed that China is building a 10,000 ft. runway on Fiery Cross Reef that could enable China to monitor and potentially control the airspace over the South China Sea, which would provide greater capability to exert sea control. China might even plan to declare an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) similar to the ADIZ it established in November 2013 in the East China Sea.

Concerned nations should also demand that the Chinese pledge that they will refrain from using these new outposts for destabilizing and coercive conduct. This should include promises not to interfere with freedom of navigation and to forego establishing an ADIZ over disputed maritime areas. To make such commitments palatable to Beijing, they could be included in a Code of Conduct that not only China, but also ASEAN members, agree to. Creating such a legally binding Code is increasingly urgent.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Keynote Speech by Ambassador Cui Tiankai at the International Conference on China-US Cooperation in Global Security Affairs</span></p>
<p align="center">April 16 2015, Washington D.C.</p>
Good morning everybody, I am very happy to be here and very happy to see some old friends and get acquaintance with new friends. I am here for two additional reasons. First, to follow the good example of Dr. Henry Kissinger. Wherever he is to share his versions about this important China-US relationship, I should be here to echo. Second, to express my appreciation and support to think tank exchanges between our two countries, China-US relations is so important. In addition to government-government ties, we should have support and participation of the general public and intellectual input from think tanks of our two countries.

Thank you President Wu for initiating this important conference. And the theme of the discussion today is of pressing importance. The world is undergoing profound changes and confronting with growing number of security challenges. Old and new, traditional and non traditional, we still have quite a few long lasting regional conflicts and resurgence of geo-politics, which is truly worrisome. We are also facing with the rise of international terrorism, extremism, proliferation and mounting ethnical and sectoral conflicts. And in a broader sense, we are confronted with security challenges such as cross border crimes, climate changes, cyber security, energy security, food security, natural disasters and infectious diseases.

China and the Untied States are respectively the biggest developing and developed countries. We are the two largest economies. Each has intensive ties with the rest of the world. We both need effective international order, a normal function of global market and stability in the world. We have common interests in addressing those security challenges together. At the same time, both of our countries are permanent members of United Nations Security Council. We are important players in existing international order. So we have shared responsibilities together with other countries to maintain international peace and stability, and bring out a safe and secure world. Relations between the United States and China are key to global stability.

It is encouraging to note that communications and coordination between our two countries on security issues, bilateral, regional and global,are making steady progress and becoming important building blocks for new model of major country relationship that we are developing. These issues are high on the agenda of high level exchanges, especially meetings between the two Presidents. We also have effective bilateral mechanism for coordination and cooperation, such as Strategic and Economic Dialogue, Strategic and Security Dialogue. Secretary Johnson of Homeland Security Department has just concluded a successful and fruitful visit to China. And two militaries are also enhancing their interaction through confidence building measures, high-level dialogues and more joint exercises and trainings, We are working together both bilaterally and multilaterally on anti-terrorism, non-proliferation, and regional issues such as Afghanistan and South Sudan. We are also working together on global challenges such as climate change and energy, food security, relief and prevention of natural disasters and prevention of disease as Ebola. This year marks the 70 anniversary of the end of the Second World War. Our countries are also working together, along with other countries to maintain and reform the international order and bring about better security of mankind.

We should be proud of what we have achieved. However, measured against the needs to respond to changing situation of mounting challenges, measured against our responsibilities to cooperate on these issues and the real potential for such cooperation, what we have already achieved is clearly not sufficient. We have to do more and much better. I think the key is our mentalities and perceptions.

Do we have ourselves on the new realities of the 21st century, or do we still believe that the world should be run in the same way as the 19th century or the early part of the 20th century?

Do we seek win-win cooperation among countries, or do we still play a zero-sum game?

Do we advocate a new concept for security that stands for common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, or do we try to achieve one's own absolute security at the expense of others?

Do we work together to build broad-based partnerships that will enable us to effectively confront the global issues for common interest, or do we still keep a narrow focus on Cold War type of alliances that actually restrict the vision, reduce the choices and will render the world more divided and less secure?

These are the choices we all have to make, and our choices will determine our future.

For China, the choice is clear, we will continue to pursue the path of peaceful development and the independent foreign policy of peace. Although China is still the world's largest developing country and faced with tremendous tasks of reform and development at home, we are keenly aware of our international responsibilities and expectation of international community. We will make even greater contributions to global peace, security, development and prosperity as our own country continues to grow.

As for relations with the US, we remain firmly committed to building a new model of relationship with the US which is characterized by no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation. And indeed, we hope that America will make the same right choice, break the constraints of unfounded worries, suspicions and fears, and join us in this common endeavor. Actually, there is no real alternative to this. Our two countries have to be on the right side of history together in order to safeguard the well-being and interests of our peoples and help make the world a better and safer place for all.

Nowadays, whatever discussion on security matters are held, maritime security is most often among the priorities. Let me take this opportunity to share with you my own views on this issue, particularly situations on South China Sea.

First, China's position regarding its territorial sovereignty is clear and consistent over many decades. Its position has not changed and will not change. This should be no surprise to anyone. While we are determined to safeguard our sovereign and maritime rights, we also exercise best restraint in handling disputes with others. We will continue to do so. It would be totally unfair, however, to ask China to give up its legitimate rights and give in to the unjustifiable demands of certain parties. Let there be no illusion that anyone could impose on China a unilateral "status quo". And let there be no illusion that anyone could repeatedly violate China's sovereignty without consequences.

Second, China stands for peaceful settlement of disputes through diplomatic dialogue and negotiations. Together with ASEAN countries, China has proposed a "dual-track approach" on the issue of South China Sea, i.e. negotiation and consultation on territorial disputes between countries directly concerned on the basis of respect for historical facts and international law, and joint efforts by China and ASEAN countries to maintain peace and stability in the region. This approach is in line with norms of international law and relevant international practices and is supported by the overwhelming majority of ASEAN members.

There is now ongoing consultation among China and ASEAN countries to formulate a code of conduct in the South China Sea. China, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia are engaged in maritime cooperation in a variety of areas. Projects funded by China-ASEAN Maritime Cooperation Fund and China-Indonesia Maritime Cooperation Fund are being implemented effectively. China and ASEAN have also designated 2015 as the year for maritime cooperation and launched an extensive program of activities.

It must be pointed out that China and ASEAN countries share much larger common interests in overall regional stability and prosperity. The bonds that unite us are much stronger and longer-lasting than any possible difference between us. Indeed, China and ASEAN countries belong to the same community of common destiny. On that solid basis, we are able to work out proper solutions to existing disputes. I am confident of that.

<span style="color: #800000;">Third, there have been some media reports recently about maintenance and construction work that China is carrying out on some of the Nansha islands and reefs. You may also have noticed the briefing given by the spokesperson of China's Foreign Ministry. Let me reiterate here that such work is well within China's sovereignty. It does not impact or target any other country. The main purpose is to improve the functions of facilities there so as to provide services to ships of China, neighboring countries and other countries that sail across the South China Sea. Such services will include shelter for ships, navigation aid, search and rescue, marine meteorological observation, fishery service and many others. Emphasis will also be put on marine environment protection.</span>

<span style="color: #800000;">Of course there will be defense facilities. This is only natural and necessary and they are purely for defensive purposes. If these facilities could not even defend themselves, how can they render service to others? If China could not safeguard its own sovereignty, how can it shoulder greater responsibilities for international stability? Therefore, building-up of China's capabilities in the South China Sea provides public goods to all and serves the interests of maintaining security, stability and freedom of navigation there.</span>

<span style="color: #800000;">Last but not least, all these must be seen and understood in the context of China's foreign policy and defense policy. China has an independent foreign policy of peace and a defense policy that is defensive in nature. They are dictated by our national goals and interests, our cultural heritage and our determination to pursue the path of peaceful development. China has long been a strong advocate for international cooperation and a staunch force for world peace. Facts show that as China grows stronger, it is better able to take up greater international responsibilities and contribute more to regional and global stability. A clear understanding of this big picture will lead to a good understanding of what China really wants and what China is doing in the region. Anyone who shares our commitment to community building in the region shall have nothing to worry about. We also seek cooperation with other countries, particularly with the United States.</span>

At the Q&amp;A session, Ambassador Cui answered a question on United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). He said, China is one of the first countries to join and ratify the UNCLOS and we take our international obligations very seriously. Of course, we welcome more countries to join us including the United States. There are two things we have to make clear. First, the Convention is not intended to resolve territorial issues. This is quite clear in the preamble of the Convention itself. Second, the Convention does not give anyone the right to conduct intensive, close-range reconnaissance activities in other countries' Exclusive Economic Zone.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[China’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/world/asia/new-images-show-china-literally-gaining-ground-in-south-china-sea.html">accelerated construction activities</a> in the South China Sea have understandably alarmed countries across the region and beyond. In particular, Southeast Asian claimant states such as Vietnam and the Philippines are deeply worried about the prospects of an irreversible Chinese consolidation of its sweeping maritime claims, more expansive Chinese paramilitary patrols in the area, and, perhaps most alarmingly, <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/11/one-year-of-adiz-what-next-for-china/">the establishment of</a> an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) across the South China Sea. Meanwhile, the U.S. seems to be primarily concerned with how China’s ambitious and sophisticated construction activities could pose a threat to its national interest in term of freedom of navigation and overflight in the area.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has also been <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/chinas-plan-obliterate-american-supremacy-12577">scrambling for an appropriate and timely response</a>, more vigorously discussing the possibility of joint patrols in the contested waters to prevent further escalation in the disputes. An often neglected aspect of the issue, however, is the ecological implications of ongoing construction activities as well as illegal, underreported, unregulated (IUU) fishing across the South China Sea. Continued failure to address the environmental time bomb in the area could lead to a major economic disaster for all claimant countries, including China.

<strong>Geo-Engineering Wonders</strong>

In fairness, China is a relative late-comer in the ongoing construction game across the South China Sea. Back in the late-20<sup>th</sup> century, Southeast Asian claimant states such as the Philippines and Northeast Asian claimant states such as Taiwan were already able to establish relatively advanced structures, including airstrips, on the Thitu and Itu Aba islands, respectively. In the Spratly chain of islands, China <a href="http://www.ellentordesillas.com/2014/08/28/magdalo-rep-scores-neglect-of-ph-occupied-territories-in-spratlys/">occupies</a> seven features (e.g., rocks, atolls, and reefs), behind Vietnam (21) and the Philippines (8).

Nonetheless, Hanoi and Manila occupy features that fall well within their 200-nautical-miles Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and continental shelf. The same cannot be said about China, the southernmost province (Hainan) of which is located considerably farther. The more important difference, however, is <a href="http://amti.csis.org/island-tracker/">the scale, speed, and sophistication</a> of China’s construction activities across the Spratly chain of islands. While the Philippines and Taiwan have been building advanced structures on actual islands -- that is to say, naturally-formed features that can support human habitation -- China <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/world/asia/new-images-show-china-literally-gaining-ground-in-south-china-sea.html">instead is artificially transforming</a> rudimentary features (e.g., low-tide elevations, reefs, rocks, atolls, etc.) into de facto islands.

The artificial and permanent alteration of the nature of a contested feature is not admissible before international law, but it allows China to achieve <em>de facto</em> – rather than <em>de jure </em>– sovereignty over contested features. After all, China <a href="http://www.cfr.org/territorial-disputes/chinese-ministry-foreign-affairs-position-paper-matter-jurisdiction-south-china-sea-arbitration/p33978">doesn’t even recognize</a> the jurisdiction of any third party, under the aegis of United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), when it comes to its sovereignty claims in adjacent waters. By all accounts, China is <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/china-dominates-the-scramble-the-south-china-sea-12443">winning the scramble in the South China Sea</a>. The accelerated pace of China’s construction activities may be linked to at least two factors.

First, China may hope to tighten its grip over contested features <a href="http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2015/04/13/China-Mischief-Reef-reclamation.html">ahead of the expected conclusion</a> of Manila’s legal arbitration against Beijing at The Hague sometime in 2016; and second, China may hope to deepen its strategic depth in the area before a more hawkish leadership replaces the Obama administration.

What China is doing in the South China Sea is nothing short of <a href="http://amti.csis.org/mischief-reef-tracker/">geo-engineering on steroids</a>. It clearly presents both military and ecological threats to the region and beyond. In strategic terms, <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/141632/andrew-s-erickson-and-austin-strange/pandoras-sandbox">construction of advanced facilities</a> allows China to establish military garrisons in the middle of the contested area, with Fiery Cross expected to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/world/asia/china-building-airstrip-in-disputed-spratly-islands-satellite-images-show.html">serve as a command-and-control center</a> for Beijing’s military and para-military activities across the South China Sea. Soon, China may be able to place advanced missile-defense systems, coordinate more sophisticated marine and air patrols in the area, and progressively prevent other neighboring countries from resupplying their personnel on features they already control.

<strong>The Environmental Conundrum </strong>

The other major concern is the potential ecological damage caused by the ongoing scramble in the South China Sea. The South China Sea is a global leader in terms of biodiversity, thanks to its warm waters and tropical weather. China <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/04/revealed-chinas-reasons-for-island-building-in-the-south-china-sea/">maintains that its construction activities are</a> in line with its “lawful”, “reasonable”, “justified”, and “inherent and indisputable sovereignty” in the area. It recently mentioned “environmental protection” and “fishery production service” as one of the core objectives of the ongoing construction activities.

Other claimant states such as the Philippines, however, argue that China’s activities <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/world/asia/chinas-island-building-is-ruining-coral-reefs-philippines-says.html?_r=0">have damaged</a> up to 300 acres of coral reefs, leading to “irreversible and widespread damage to the biodiversity and ecological balance” and costing neighboring states up to $100 million annually due to the negative impact on coral reefs, which are breeding grounds for high-value fisheries. Philippines’ coral reefs have also been damaged by <a href="http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/439700/news/nation/phl-gets-p87-m-compensation-from-us-over-tubbataha-damage">American</a> (<em>USS Guardian</em>) and <a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/71565/chinese-fishing-vessel-grounded-at-tubbataha-reef/">Chinese</a> vessels in recent years. By some estimates, <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/04/the-other-problem-in-the-south-china-sea/">70% of coral reefs</a> in the South China Sea have already been adversely affected by a combination of pollution, unsound fishing practices, mechanical accidents, and climate change.

Fisheries resources have been <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/28/us-southchinasea-china-fishing-insight-idUSKBN0FW0QP20140728">severely undermined</a> due to over-exploitation and large-scale illegal fishing. In recent years, the Philippines has repeatedly apprehended <a href="http://globalnews.ca/news/1325136/chinese-fisherman-charged-with-poaching-500-endangered-sea-turtles/">Chinese</a> and <a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/88389/13-vietnamese-arrested-in-philippines-over-sea-turtles/">Vietnamese</a> fishermen for poaching endangered species such as sea turtles within its EEZ. Desperate to stem illegal fishing by foreign vessels within its waters, Indonesia has resorted to a more aggressive <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/01/explaining-indonesias-sink-the-vessels-policy-under-jokowi/">‘sink the vessels’</a> policy. With China increasingly <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/143659/andrew-s-erickson-and-conor-m-kennedy/chinas-island-builders?cid=rss-rss_xml-chinas_island_builders-000000">relying on its</a> fishermen-cum-militia armada to consolidate its claims in the South China Sea, illegal, underreported, unregulated (IUU) fishing will most likely intensify.

From the Northern Pacific, North Sea, and the Baltic to the Mediterranean and even <a href="http://webservices.itcs.umich.edu/drupal/mebm/?q=node/47">the Yellow Sea</a>, there have been numerous and relatively advanced efforts at establishing fisheries management and related environmental-protection regimes. As <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/biodiversityworkinggroup/webpage_legal%20and%20policy.pdf">signatories to the UNCLOS and Convention on Biological Diversity</a>, South China Sea claimant states should begin to seriously discuss necessary measures to address the brewing environmental crisis, which will affect the livelihood of tens of millions of people in the area with unimaginable socio-political and economic repercussions. This may after all be the biggest challenge in the South China Sea.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Furthering U.S. Strategic Goals in the South China Sea</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[China’s <a href="http://amti.csis.org/island-tracker/">reclamation blitz</a> in the Spratly Islands continues unabated, despite condemnation from fellow claimants and outside nations. Chinese dredging ships have been hard at work expanding at least seven features: Cuarteron, Gaven, Hughes, Fiery Cross, Johnson South, Mischief, and Subi reefs. Their work will be largely complete in a matter of months, presenting the region with a fait accompli.

Given the devastating environmental impacts, worrying effect on the regional security environment, and <a href="http://amti.csis.org/the-legal-challenge-of-chinas-island-building/">legal violations</a> involved, Washington and its partners are desperate for ways to prevent or deter China from changing further facts on the ground. But that goal alone will not lead to a sound strategy. The situation has been changed too drastically for there to be any going back to the precarious balance in place prior to 2009.

And the current status quo is inherently unstable. A new round of escalation is always just over the horizon, whether caused by a ruling from the arbitration tribunal at The Hague, a violent run-in between the increasing number of Chinese paramilitary forces and Southeast Asian fishermen, or the collapse of the rusted-out BRP <em>Sierra Madre</em> along with the Filipino troops aboard. Any sound strategy from Washington cannot just revolve around how to prevent further provocations; it must help set the conditions for a sustainable solution to the disputes.

The top priorities for the United States and its regional partners are seeing that the South China Sea disputes be resolved peacefully and according to international law. Much of current U.S. strategy is already geared toward ensuring those two conditions. The United States is engaged in substantial efforts to bolster Southeast Asian states’ maritime domain awareness, patrol, and deterrence capabilities, all to prevent more blatant Chinese aggression. Washington is also putting considerable diplomatic effort into pushing all claimants, not just China, to bring their claims into <a href="http://cogitasia.com/beijings-and-washingtons-dueling-south-china-sea-papers/">accordance with international law</a>. These efforts must be sustained and Washington must cajole others to support them.

But in light of the unprecedented escalation presented by Beijing’s reclamation efforts, Washington should consider other steps to support the conditions for a long-term resolution.

The State Department, through its Limits in the Sea series, has provided legal analyses of the claims of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. The glaring omission is that of Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur has failed to give an accounting of its territorial baselines, and its claim is often still depicted based upon a map of its continental shelf issued in 1979. But its 2009 submission to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf invalidated that map. As a matter of fairness, and a relatively easy step, the State Department should issue a position paper on Malaysia’s maritime claims and strongly urge Kuala Lumpur to clarify them in accordance with international law.

Each year, the U.S. military performs Freedom of Navigation (FON) operations and other activities to challenge excessive maritime claims. In fiscal year 2014, U.S. forces challenged claims of 19 nations, including China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. In light of China’s reclamation work, the Department of Defense should add a FON operation to the 2015 calendar to assert that those new features built on low-tide elevations are legally artificial islands entitled under international law to no more than a 500 meter, or 1,640 foot, safety zone. A U.S. Navy ship should transit within 12 nautical miles of one of these reclaimed features (but beyond the 12 nautical mile territorial sea of any nearby rocks).

Legally China could challenge such passage only by claiming a low-tide elevations as a rock or island entitled to a territorial sea. That would place Beijing in an absurd legal position. It is equally likely that Beijing would recognize this absurdity and not publicly object to such a FON operation. In either case, the operation would offer clarity on what China considers these reclaimed features to be. And more importantly, it would substantially help what should be a long-term U.S. goal—pressuring China to clarify its ambiguous maritime claims and thereby shrink the size of the area in dispute to a more manageable space in which claimants can be urged to cooperate.

While there is plenty of opportunity for conflict between China and Vietnam, the most likely scenario for an escalation to violence in the South China Sea involves a run-in between Chinese and Philippine forces, which could worryingly draw in the United States. Between Scarborough Shoal, the ongoing cat and mouse game at Second Thomas Shoal, and continued tensions over Reed Bank, the opportunities for a skirmish are worryingly high. That has only been made truer by the increasing number of Chinese paramilitary units in the Spratlys, whose position is clearly bolstered by the reclamation work.

As such, the White House should give renewed thought to clarifying the scope of its commitment to defend Philippine troops in areas of dispute. It has for years offered an explicit guarantee of protection to Japanese forces on the Senkakus, arguing that it remains neutral on the dispute but sees the features as being under effective Japanese administration. The same should be said of Philippine controlled features, or Philippine forces that come under unprovoked aggression in disputed waters. Such clarity comes with its own risks, but the costs of continued ambiguity have become too high.

Washington’s current strategy trusts that both Beijing and Manila understand where the trigger for U.S. intervention lies—a point not even entirely clear to U.S. policymakers. That is a dangerous assumption given the increasingly frequent interactions between Chinese and Philippine forces in and around the Spratlys. A clarification of U.S. commitments would not only deter China from accidentally overstepping a red line it did not know existed; it would also restrain the Philippines from adventurism that it might falsely believe the United States would support.

It would also go a long way toward countering voices in the Philippines, particularly on the political left, who argue that the U.S. commitment cannot be trusted. And it could help depoliticize the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, signed by the United States and the Philippines in 2014, which would allow U.S. troops and equipment to rotate through Philippine bases on a temporary basis. A clarification of the U.S. commitment may help overcome some of the political concerns that currently see the agreement mired in the Philippine Supreme Court.

<div class="view-label view-field-field-publication-date-value"><span class="date-display-single">APR 28, 2015</span></div>
President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan held a summit meeting at the White House today in conjunction with Abe’s official visit to the United States, the first by a Japanese prime minister in nine years. The visit demonstrates the strength of this alliance to audiences at home in Japan and the United States and in Asia, a region increasingly challenged by uncertainty about the rise of China. The summit meeting was anchored by three core themes.  First, the two leaders endorsed new guidelines for U.S.-Japan defense cooperation in response to a range of regional and global security challenges. Second, they reaffirmed a commitment to strengthen the economic pillar of the alliance by concluding bilateral trade negotiations linked to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and addressed cooperation on global issues including development cooperation, climate change, global health and nuclear security. Third, history also features in the bilateral relationship this year, the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, and on April 29 Prime Minister Abe is expected to reflect on the past and discuss the evolution of the U.S.-Japan alliance as the first Japanese leader to address a joint session of Congress.  Abe’s visit signifies a joint effort to further develop a strategic framework for the alliance based on shared regional and global interests.
<div class="view-field view-data-body">

<strong>Q1: What is the meaning of the defense guidelines?</strong>

<strong>A1:</strong> On April 27 the bilateral Security Consultative Committee or “2+2”, composed of the U.S. secretaries of state and defense and their Japanese counterparts, released updated guidelines for bilateral defense cooperation.  The 1960 bilateral security treaty obligates the United States to defend Japan in exchange for access to bases in Japan for maintaining regional peace and security. This foundation for the U.S.-Japan alliance remains intact but Japanese defense policy and bilateral cooperation have evolved over time in response to changes in the security environment. Guidelines for defense cooperation were first introduced in 1978 to clarify priorities for the defense of Japan during the Cold War and were updated in 1997 to incorporate regional security. However, actual planning proved difficult without knowing whether Japan would exercise the right of collective self-defense, or come to the aid of U.S. forces under attack.  The new guidelines are intended to build on defense policy reforms announced by the Abe government last year including measures that would allow Japan’s Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to exercise collective self-defense, a right of all nations under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.

The new guidelines impact bilateral security cooperation in two fundamental ways. First, they broaden the scope of functional cooperation to include a range of areas such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, air and missile defense, maritime security, space and cyber, peacekeeping operations, partner capacity building, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and noncombatant evacuation operations. Second, the guidelines deepen bilateral security cooperation by further integrating SDF and U.S. military operations, as well as coordination with third countries. Requisite legislation detailing SDF operations will be subject to parliamentary approval and submitted for debate later this spring, but the new guidelines reference the ability of the SDF to respond not only to an armed attack against Japan but also an armed attack against a foreign country that is in a close relationship with Japan if it threatens Japan’s survival and the Japanese people’s right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as prescribed in the Japanese constitution. Possible examples of SDF operations referenced in the guidelines include asset protection (during non-combatant evacuation operations, for example), search and rescue, maritime operations (minesweeping; escort operations; interdiction), intercepting ballistic missiles and logistics support. The United States and Japan do not have a joint and combined command like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or the U.S. alliance with the Republic of Korea. In fact, Japan’s new policy on collective self-defense focuses on integration with U.S. or other forces from the rear and not on offensive operations.

The guidelines also emphasize joint research, development and production of defense equipment to reflect the Abe government’s decision to relax restrictions on arms exports with the potential to enhance economic efficiency and interoperability between the two militaries. In the face of budgetary constraints in both capitals, jointness and interoperability are critical capabilities for the alliance that can strengthen deterrence in the Asia Pacific region. The two governments have noted that the guidelines are not bound by geography nor aimed at any specific country, but the reality is that this new chapter in U.S.-Japan defense cooperation is in part a response to the increasing threat from North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs as well as China’s military build-up and recent assertiveness in support of its maritime sovereignty claims in the East and South China Seas. The two governments should not shy away from discussing the importance of strengthening deterrence to maintain regional security while exploring opportunities to reduce tensions when possible.

<strong>Q2: Will the summit inject momentum into bilateral negotiations over TPP?</strong>

<strong>A2: </strong>The two leaders issued a joint vision statement for the alliance including a shared commitment to regional economic prosperity based on efforts to promote high standards for trade and investment through TPP. The statement welcomed “significant progress” in bilateral trade negotiations linked to the broader agreement and reiterated a commitment to bring negotiations with the other parties to a successful conclusion. Prime Minister Abe noted in an interview prior to his departure from Japan that the two governments were close to concluding a bilateral agreement but Japanese tariffs on rice and U.S. tariffs on automobile parts remain sticking points. The introduction of trade promotion authority (TPA) legislation in the Congress and President Obama’s vocal defense of trade liberalization in recent weeks have improved the prospects for TPP in Washington, but the politics of trade remain complicated. The Abe visit to Washington had been widely viewed as an action-forcing event for completing the bilateral deal and giving momentum to the 12-country negotiations, and the lack of an agreement will disappoint and worry TPP advocates. TPP is critical to Japan’s economic reform agenda and the credibility of the U.S. strategic rebalance to Asia. Based on the progress they achieved bilaterally, Tokyo and Washington are likely to step up their efforts over the next several weeks to persuade the other ten TPP countries to quickly conclude an overall deal.

<strong>Q3: Are there other issues animating the bilateral agenda?</strong>

<strong>A3:</strong> The joint vision statement and an accompanying fact sheet also emphasize cooperation on global issues such as climate change, energy, sustainable growth, development cooperation, global health, countering violent extremism, maritime security, advancing human rights, promoting girls education and women’s empowerment, and strengthening United Nations peacekeeping. The two governments also released a statement on nuclear security in conjunction with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty Review Conference in New York and committed to strengthening the treaty’s three pillars of nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation, and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The bilateral agenda clearly places great emphasis on promoting globally recognized rules and norms and strengthening regional and global institutions.

<strong>Q4: Is history a factor? </strong>

<strong>A4:</strong> August marks the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II and the Abe government is expected to issue a statement reflecting on history. The U.S.-Japan joint vision statement issued today notes that the U.S.-Japan relationship is a model of the power of reconciliation as one-time adversaries were able to develop an alliance based on shared values and common interests.  President Obama accompanied Prime Minister Abe to the Lincoln Memorial on April 27 and referenced this stop during a joint press conference today when discussing the importance of reconciliation in a bilateral context. Abe also visited the Holocaust Museum and Arlington Cemetery. Broad public support for the alliance in Japan and the United States notwithstanding, history is a theme for the bilateral relationship.

There is broad support for Japan in Asia and recent polls show 96 percent of Southeast Asians have a positive view of Japan. China continues to hold up history as an obstacle to regional diplomacy but the key for the United States is the Republic of Korea, a close U.S. ally that would like Abe to issue a fresh apology to the euphemistically named “comfort women” forced to provide sexual services to Japanese soldiers during the war. In a joint press conference with the president today Abe said he was “deeply pained to think about the comfort women who experienced immeasurable pain and suffering as a result of victimization due to human trafficking.” Observers will focus intently on how Abe chooses to address history issues in his address to Congress on April 29.

<strong>Q5: Is the U.S.-Japan alliance on track? </strong>

<strong>A5:</strong> Despite questions about whether the Obama administration might embrace Chinese president Xi Jinping’s call for a “new model of great power relations” that would implicitly diminish Japan’s status, this summit should leave no doubt about the centrality of the U.S.-Japan alliance to U.S. strategy in Asia and Japanese foreign policy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="view-field view-data-field-related-expert-nid">By <a href="http://csis.org/expert/michael-j-green">Michael J. Green</a><span class="list-comma">, </span><a href="http://csis.org/expert/nicholas-szechenyi">Nicholas Szechenyi</a></div>
<div class="view-label view-field-field-publication-date-value"> <span class="date-display-single">APR 29, 2015</span></div>
Today Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan became the first Japanese leader ever to address a joint session of Congress. Abe summarized key themes for U.S.-Japan relations including history, as August marks the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.
<div class="view-field view-data-body">

<strong>Q1: What were the core themes of the speech?</strong>

<strong>A1:</strong> Abe stressed the economic and strategic importance of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) to Japan and the United States and called for joint leadership to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion. He also summarized his domestic economic reform agenda with references to agriculture, corporate governance, deregulation, and women’s empowerment. Abe then discussed the agenda for the bilateral security alliance including the new guidelines for defense cooperation, networking with other countries in the region, and maritime security. This review of the current policy landscape was designed to highlight Abe’s commitment to the U.S.-Japan alliance and a continued leadership role for Japan in international affairs. But his address began with reflections on World War II and the process of reconciliation between the two countries.

<strong>Q2: How did Prime Minister Abe address history issues?</strong>

<strong>A2:</strong> Abe visited the World War II Memorial prior to the speech and used the term “deep repentance” when reflecting on that experience. He made a statement about the war: “My dear friends, on behalf of Japan and the Japanese people, I offer with profound respect my eternal condolences to the souls of all American people that were lost during World War II.” Abe then recognized a U.S. veteran of the Battle of Iwo Jima and a Japanese lawmaker whose grandfather was the commander of the Japanese garrison at Iwo Jima to commemorate efforts at reconciliation between the two countries that served as a foundation for the U.S.-Japan alliance. Abe also stated that Japan’s actions brought suffering to the people of Asia and that he would uphold statements on the war expressed by previous prime ministers.

<strong>Q3: Did Abe say enough about the past?</strong>

<strong>A3: </strong>The speech was well received in Congress, but there were protests by Korean-American groups elsewhere who called on Abe to issue an apology to Korean “comfort women” forced to provide sexual services to Japanese soldiers during the war. Abe was asked about this issue during his joint press conference with President Obama on April 28 and said he was “deeply pained to think about the comfort women who experienced immeasurable pain and suffering as a result of victimization due to human trafficking.” (He used similar language when asked about this issue during a speech at Harvard University on April 27.) Abe used new language when reflecting on this issue and in his congressional speech stressed the importance of preventing human rights abuses against women in the context of Japan taking responsibility for peace and stability in the world.

The Japanese government has apologized repeatedly for the war, and Prime Minister Tony Abbott of Australia and others have noted that a new official apology is not necessary. Those close to Abe believe his commitment to uphold previous government statements and recent expressions of remorse constitute a sincere effort to address this issue, and the Abe government has established an advisory committee to help shape a statement to be issued on August 15, the 70th anniversary of the end of the war. Abe’s treatment of the past probably met expectations in the United States but almost certainly will not meet demands in China, where delegitimization of Japan has become a central narrative. The administration will be most interested in the official Korean reaction, since reconciliation between Japan and Korea has been an important strategic objective as the United States seeks to strengthen security relations under the rebalance to Asia.

Abe’s visit to Washington was important for U.S.-Japan relations and set the tone for this anniversary year in reflecting on the past and celebrating the remarkable transformation of the relationship into an alliance for hope.

		<title>The U.S.-Japan Alliance Upgrades and Maritime Contention in Asia</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Monday, the U.S. and Japanese government announced the conclusion of their upgrade of their alliance.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> The U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation Guidelines have been revised for the second time since they were drafted in 1978, first in 1997 to respond to the early disruptions after the end of the Cold War, and today to cope with the increasing need for crisis management and for cooperation in the new domains of maritime, space and cyber security. If successful, these guidelines will ensure that there is seamless coordination between Tokyo and Washington, and a full understanding of how to avoid the escalation of conflict, especially in maritime Asia.

This effort to upgrade the alliance to a rapidly changing Asia is long overdue.   For more than a decade, alliance managers on both sides of the Pacific have hoped to develop a clearer understanding of the roles, missions and capabilities of the Japanese and U.S. militaries. Since the last guidelines, North Korea has gone nuclear, and while Japan has embraced ballistic missile defense in response,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> North Korea’s episodic provocations continue to stoke fears in the region. Likewise, the increasing maritime presence of China in and beyond the East China Sea has raised concerns about what this might mean for the U.S. commitment to defend Japan. The Chinese decision to deploy its paramilitary ships, its white hulls, to patrol the Senkakus also raised new questions about the “grey zone” between law enforcement and maritime defenses, a grey zone that had long separated Japan’s own thinking about how to defend its coastal waters.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>

Since tensions first spiked between Tokyo and Beijing after a Chinese fishing trawler captain rammed Japan Coast Guard vessels in 2010, the United States has worried about the deterioration of bilateral ties between the two Asian powers.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>  The leadership change in Beijing raised questions about the new vision of Xi Jinping, and also affected the way in which both Tokyo and Washington could communicate their concerns to Beijing. When another round of tensions erupted in 2012, the introduction of Chinese vessels in the Senkaku waters brought the dangers of escalation to a new level, and by early 2013, it was clear that a mishap or misjudgment could easily propel China and Japan towards the use of military force. Many feared that heated popular sentiment would exacerbate the sovereignty dispute making the spiral of escalation especially difficult to control.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>

The United States and Japan had experience in thinking about integrating force deployments and developing new capabilities to deter aggression, but they had far less experience in thinking about how to integrate their response to manage this kind of escalatory dynamic. Controlling incidents in the East China Sea before they involve militaries will depend on communication in real time between Japan’s Coast Guard and the Self Defense Force, and while the two agencies had established information sharing and discussed cooperation protocols since the arrival of North Korea’s suspicious ships in Japanese waters in the late 1990s, formal planning on incident management was far from complete. The U.S. forces stationed in and around Japan, too, played an important role in deterring aggression, but incidents below the level of a military threat were not part of the bilateral planning conversation.  To start with, Tokyo and Washington quickly identified the need for greater situational awareness and more coordination of their respective intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance efforts.

But the larger question for the alliance, one that the Guidelines only begin to address, is how to avoid conflict in Asia’s maritime spaces. The East China Sea falls more easily into our traditional thinking about the scope of the alliance, and Japan’s new island defense priority emphasizes this mission. Yet we must also consider maritime cooperation beyond the defense of Japan scenario. Now that the Chinese maritime presence in and around the Senkakus has become regularized, a certain amount of predictability in the interactions between the coast guards has resulted.  After Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with President Xi Jinping at last November’s APEC meeting, Tokyo and Beijing resumed their stalled effort at developing maritime confidence building.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>   Xi’s recognition of the need for risk reduction was a critical step forward.  It also helped that in his meeting with President Barack Obama, Xi also signed on to naval confidence building norms and protocols as well.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>   In other words, China's confidence building conversations between the United States and Japan, respectively, offer some hope for managing the risk of unintended conflict. Here we should not forget that Taiwan’s interests too come into play, and President Ma Ying-jeou’s leadership in defusing Japan-Taiwan tensions over the islands in late 2012 played an important role in managing East China Sea tensions.

More difficult will be the task of alliance cooperation in the South China Sea. Admiral Robert Thomas, Commander of the Seventh Fleet, made a public statement that he would welcome Japanese patrols of the South China Sea and this surprised many.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> But it did raise an important subject, and that is Japan’s need to defend its sea-lanes of communication (SLOCs). Since the 1980s, Japan has been willing to define its responsibility for its southern trade routes up to 1,000 nautical miles from its coast. Japan's navy works closely with the United States on the RIMPAC exercises, and on Western Pacific cooperation.

Today, there is additional opportunity for the United States and Japan to consider how they might build capacities around the region.  Many Asian countries depend just as much on the same sea-lanes, and to unimpeded access to the Straits of Malacca, through which 25 percent of global trade.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> The Abe Cabinet has concluded assistance programs to its southern maritime neighbors, the Philippines and Vietnam, which will help them with their own coastal defenses.  Tokyo too has long been a supporter of ASEAN maritime capacity building, including humanitarian and disaster relief efforts, and has expanded its maritime role to include the anti-piracy coalition in the Gulf of Aden.  In this latter multilateral coalition, Japan’s Maritime Self Defense Force has worked alongside the Chinese PLA Navy, another important avenue for building maritime confidence between Beijing and Tokyo.  Finally, the growing Japanese security partnership with Australia in the Western Pacific should not be underestimated, and Prime Ministers Abe and Tony Abbott have moved to a conversation about Australia’s purchase of Japanese submarines.

The U.S. -Japan Guidelines revision comes at a time when Japan is better positioned for regional cooperation than it has been in decades.  Of course, the design of a new bilateral crisis management mechanism will reassure many in both capitals that the alliance is ready to cope with emergencies should they occur.  But the broader task of creating a stable maritime domain in the Asia Pacific demands that the alliance broaden its range of vision, both geographically and in terms of new missions.   Beyond the guidelines, the Abe Cabinet has signaled it is ready for a much larger military role in the region.   It has centralized its own institutions, including the new NSC, it has pursued deeper strategic cooperation with Australia and India, and it has relaxed restrictions on defense technology transfer.

What remains to be built now are mechanisms for regional dispute resolution and for regional maritime stability in both the East and South China Seas. Chinese building on the Spratly Islands signals a challenge to the idea that the nations of Asia can negotiate their maritime interests.  Understanding what is happening in the maritime commons is the first place to start.  This is important not only for militaries but for many others.  Fishermen, conservationists, aviators, and law enforcement officials tracking traffickers and smugglers all need to have better awareness of the waters in which they operate, and this is particularly urgent for the expansive but increasingly populated waters of the Asia Pacific. The United States and Japan must work with other partners in the region to ensure the transparency and maritime awareness for the region.  Risk reduction cannot simply be a bilateral endeavor, but must be integrated into maritime institutions that ensure the protection of commerce and respect the territorial integrity of all Asian nations.

		<title>The Maritime Security Implications of the New U.S.-Japan Guidelines</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The new U.S.-Japan Defense Guidelines will upgrade bilateral operational cooperation and enhance the alliance structure. The new Guidelines enable Japanese and U.S. forces to conduct effective combined operations defending each other’s units and assets in the high seas—even beyond Japanese territorial waters. The new Alliance Coordination Mechanism will endorse this upgraded operational cooperation. Under this new Mechanism, the Japan Self-Defense Force (JSDF) and U.S. military will share information and situational awareness from peacetime to gray-zone and full-fledged military contingencies, while coordinating bilateral responses. The Guidelines will have huge implications for U.S.-Japan cooperation in the maritime domain.

For the last several years, China has been challenging Japanese territory and sovereignty in the East China Sea. China recognizes that the overall military balance still favors Japan and the United States, and therefore takes measures short of armed attack to avoid U.S. military intervention. The first responder to Chinese gray-zone challenges in the East China Sea is the Japan Coast Guard (JCG). By involving JCG in the Alliance Coordination Mechanism, the alliance can effectively respond to Chinese creeping coercion. The new Guidelines will also allow the JSDF and US forces to prepare flexible deterrent options (FDOs) for escalation control. By demonstrating its will and determination through the deployment of allied units, the alliance can dominate escalation.

The new Guidelines will enhance overall deterrence too. An increasingly important aspect of alliance deterrence is its ability to respond to China’s precision strike capabilities. The new Guidelines refer to dispersion, hardening, and resiliency of existing facilities to deal with China’s ballistic missile threat vis-à-vis, for instance, Kadena Airbase in Okinawa. Even after a Chinese ballistic missile attack, the alliance will maintain counterattack capabilities using other military and commercial facilities, while rapidly recovering damaged ones.

The new Guidelines also define the division of labor between the JSDF and U.S. military for island defense. This is to endorse US commitment to defend the Senkaku Islands and the entire Japanese southwestern island chain. The traditional alliance division of labor was spear and shield—U.S. forces provide offensive strike capabilities and JSDF provide defensive measures. In island defense, however, the JSDF takes the primary responsibility through the Dynamic Joint Defense Force, while the U.S. military plays a supporting role with strategic strike capabilities.

Maritime security and the protection of freedom of navigation without geographical restriction is a core of the new Guidelines. The alliance will continue to be a major security provider for the Taiwan Strait. Given the ongoing Chinese land reclamation and nuclear submarine (SSBN) program in the South China Sea, the new Guidelines will enable Japan-U.S. cooperation for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) in these troubled waters. Japanese ISR activities in the South China Sea will not only secure freedom of navigation but also maintain the credibility of the U.S. nuclear umbrella. The new Guidelines also assume bilateral cooperation for minesweeping and ship inspection in the international waters.

The new Guidelines call for cooperation with third parties. The alliance can work more with Australia in the Pacific and India in the Indian Ocean. The alliance can conduct more effective and efficient capacity building for countries like the Philippines and Vietnam, too. U.S.-Japan cooperation for the new Australian submarine program will enhance underwater superiority of the alliance in the Pacific.

The Guidelines need to be endorsed by Japanese domestic security legislation reform. The ruling coalition of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Komeito has already agreed on the content of the legislation, and they will pass it in the Diet by summer. The new security legislation will allow the JSDF to use force, only in a situation that threatens Japan’s national survival. But how that is defined remains to be seen— Komeito is still reluctant to regard a threat to Japanese sea lanes as a threat to national survival. Seventy years ago, Japan was defeated not by atomic bombing but by commercial raid. To make the new Guidelines work for maritime security, Japanese political leaders need to reach a consensus on the importance of sea lanes, and their role in national defense.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It has been nearly 15 years since the alliance last revised the <em>Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation</em>.  Both governments revised these Guidelines as a part of the security relationship’s transition to the post-Cold War environment, while abiding by the constraints of Japan defense policies at that time.  Speaking of the 1997 Defense Guidelines, Japan’s Ambassador to the United States, Kenichiro Sasae, noted that at that time we had “ . . . no smart phones, no texting, and no GPS devices.”  In that context it was a long time ago, and in the context of U.S.-Japan bilateral defense cooperation the alliance has clearly come a long way.  As the following paragraphs explain, many of the bilateral changes in the revised Guidelines are precipitated by changes to Japan’s defense and security policies, all of which are welcomed by U.S. alliance managers.  Both sides have gained from lessons learned over the years, and the new areas incorporated in the 2015 Guidelines support the overall U.S. concept of <em>rebalance</em> outlined in the January 2012 policy “Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership:  Priorities for 21<sup>st</sup> Century Defense.”

<strong>Why Revise?</strong>

There are several key factors that drove both governments to revise the 1997 Guidelines.  One is the security environment.  The Joint Statement of the Security Consultative Committee (SCC) that released the 2015 Defense Guidelines notes that the alliance faces an “increasingly complex security environment.”  Tensions have risen with China’s assertiveness over its territorial claims in East China and South China Seas, North Korea continues to provoke others with its nuclear and missile development, and Russia has increased its military aircraft activity approaching and entering Japan’s airspace.

Second, since the 1997 Guidelines Japan’s contributions to global security have grown, most recently with the Abe administration policy for <em>Proactive Contributions to Peace</em>. Japan and the U.S. worked together in OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM, deployed for operations in Iraq, conducted anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden, and responded with humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to several natural disasters, most significantly the March 2011 humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations in Japan’s northeast.  Lessons learned from these events proved valuable in envisioning how U.S. and Japanese forces should work together, and the two governments could better coordinate.  The Bilateral Coordination Mechanism established in the 1997 Guidelines proved to be insufficient for OPERATION TOMODACHI, lacking the full complement of government agencies to address the combined challenges of a disaster created by an earthquake, tsunami, and radiological exposure.

A third reason to update the Guidelines is Japan’s revisions of its defense and security policies. Japan’s bold policy revisions of its Constitutional interpretation to authorize areas of collective self-defense, relaxation of its export policy to allow the export of arms and technologies to qualified partners, and security policy formulations on space and cyber security expanded the scope for bilateral cooperation. It was important to determine how the alliance should incorporate these areas to strengthen effectiveness.

<strong>The 2015 Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation</strong>

A theme reiterated throughout the new Guidelines is cooperation that is <em>seamless, robust, flexible, and effective</em>.  It is important that alliance planning and consideration extend throughout the spectrum of contingencies to address the so-called grey-zone challenges that fall between peacetime and armed conflict.  In this regard, the term of art <em>Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan </em>that appeared as a key element of the 1997 Guidelines to express alliance interest beyond the defense of Japan from which implementing legislation was passed, is no longer Guidelines lexicon.  Japan continues to maintain its basic defense policies centered on an exclusively defense-oriented framework, and non-nuclear principles.

Japan’s July 1, 2014 Cabinet decision authorizing applications of collective self-defense removes a significant obstacle to Alliance cooperation.  The Guidelines incorporate this adjustment noting various areas where Japan’s Self Defense Forces may now defend U.S. forces, and assets in Japan; during operations in the defense of Japan on the ground, sea, and air; during peacekeeping operations; and for air and missile defense.  The 2015 document includes broad lessons learned from March 2011, specifically addressing contingencies that may include chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear incidents or attacks.  While men and women on both sides of the Alliance served admirably during OPERATION TOMODACHI, the operation also demonstrated that the two governments required broader connection across the whole of governments, smoother execution for crisis planning and crisis management, and greater familiarity.  The new document replaces the Bilateral Coordination Mechanism –an on-call body–to coordinate crisis planning and management with a more robust and standing Alliance Coordination Mechanism that includes the whole-of-government.

Japan’s adjustment to its arms export policies allows greater cooperation with the U.S. in a variety of forms.  The Guidelines outline coordination in areas of efficient acquisition and maintenance, and specifically note cooperation in areas of research, development, production, and test and evaluation.  They do not specifically, however, mention a long-range effort to cooperatively work on co-development, co-production, and co-employment for operational capabilities for our future forces.  The U.S.-Japan bilateral program on missile defense was authorized on an exceptional basis in this regard.  With Japan’s adjustment in arms export principles, however, the alliance can systematically work on long-range operational requirements and capabilities.  This requires both sides to exchange long-range estimates of the security environment, threats, and challenges to identify mutual operational requirements for future forces.  As two of the most technologically advanced countries in the world, this is an endeavor that the alliance should seize.

Under the rubric of regional and global efforts, the 2015 Guidelines introduces “Partner Capacity Building” with an aim to build capacities throughout the region “to respond to dynamic security challenges.”  This is a growth area for the alliance that aligns goals between the Department of Defense and its Defense Institution Building (DIB) programs with the Defense Ministry’s Capacity Building programs to build capacities throughout the region.

The 2015 Guidelines is a document that outlines a more balanced relationship of responsibilities between not only Japan’s Ground Self-Defense Forces and U.S. forces, but the two governments overall.  The Security Consultative Committee’s (SCC) approval of the revised Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation marks the end of a beginning.  It completes a near two-year process to revise a framework for bilateral defense policy.  However, as with most policy formulations, this new beginning now requires implementation.  Japan will undergo a legislative process to amend several defense related laws.  Much of the bilateral work will require further action on the part of Subcommittee for Defense Cooperation (SDC), the bilateral body, which supports the SCC. Planning guidance and priorities should be formulated and issued to implement new areas of the guidelines.  As the SCC Joint Statement appropriately noted, “the SCC directed the SDC to implement the new Guidelines, including establishing the standing Alliance Coordination Mechanism and upgrading the Bilateral Planning Mechanism.” Implementation with due urgency will be key to preparing the alliance for future emergencies that the alliance is sure to encounter.]]></content:encoded>

<em>Transcript By </em><em>Superior Transcriptions LLC

&nbsp;

COLM QUINN:  Afternoon, everybody.  This is Colm Quinn from CSIS.  I’m here with our principals for this call we’re doing today.  I’ve got Mike Green, our SVP for Asia and our Japan Chair; Matt Goodman, our Simon Chair in Political Economy and senior adviser in Asian economics; as well as Nick Szechenyi, who’s our deputy director and senior fellow with the Japan Chair.

I’m going to give it over to Mike Green to begin.  And he’s going to have some quick remarks and then pass it over to Matt Goodman for his take, and then we’ll open up for a Q&amp;A.

MICHAEL J. GREEN:  So, hi, thanks.  It’s Mike Green.  I’m going to open up, and then I’ll ask my colleague, Matt Goodman, to give comments.

There were three big themes in the trip, and they were all in the prime minister’s speech today.  First, the issuance of new defense guidelines moving our alliance with Japan into a new era.  Second, movement towards the final phase of completing a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which Matt will talk about.  And third, in the background for all of this, how the prime minister would address the 70<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the end of World War II.  So let me spend just a few minutes on the first and third, starting with the new defense guidelines.

These were signed or agreed upon Monday, the president and prime minister reaffirmed them yesterday, and it came up in today’s speech.  The defense guidelines have been issued twice before.  These ones address and change the alliance in two ways, really.  First, they broaden the areas where we cooperate:  cyberspace, outer space, and domains and functional areas where the challenges are clearly more significant than they were a decade or two ago.  And the second area where it changes the way we work with Japan as allies is in the integration or tightening of our security cooperation.  And that second part, I think, is the most significant dimension of this.

Our alliances with Korea, our alliance with NATO, the NATO alliance, have joint and combined command structures.  That means you have American generals or admirals commanding European troops or Korean troops, and vice versa.  Our operational plans and our intelligence is fused and joint.  The U.S.-Japan alliance from the beginning has been two separate military establishments, in large part because the Japanese, for most of the postwar era, did not want to be involved in any of the Americans’ Cold War security operations.  And the change here that is most significant is in that respect.  We still will not have a joint and combined command like we do with Korea or with NATO, but we’re going to come much closer because on July 1<sup>st</sup> Prime Minister Abe’s Cabinet agreed that Japan would recognize the right of collective self-defense, a right in the U.N. Charter given to every country, to come to the assistance of an ally that’s under attack with your own forces.  And in July, the Cabinet in Japan decided Japan would have that right.  It always did – you know, constitution never contradicted it – it just never exercised the right.

So based on that, the guidelines now have real meaning.  And Japan will now – pending legislation in Japan, in the Diet, Japan will now have the ability to be integrated into U.S. use of force to protect American property, to defend American forces, to sanitize sea lanes or defend against missiles, if the U.S. military is in operations anywhere in the world.  What Japan will not be able to do is engage in offensive operations or attacks against other countries at the pointy end of the spear.

So this is an important step forward.  It’s not as far as NATO or the U.S.-Korea alliance.  It’s not a joint and combined command, and Japan will not be involved in offensive operations.  But it’s a huge relief for the U.S. to have that support, which we’ve needed for a long time, and it’s welcomed everywhere in Asia except China and North Korea.  The Korean Defense Ministry, though they have concerns about security, has welcomed it, for example.

Turning briefly to the history issues, it’s the 70<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the war.  As a candidate for prime minister, Prime Minister Abe suggested he would think about changing some of the traditional or some of the past official apologies by his predecessors when he issued his own statement on the 70<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the war.  He’s largely moved – he’s moved away from that.

This was important for the administration, not because Southeast Asia or South Asia are viewing this as an obstacle to cooperation with Japan – Japan has excellent actual polling numbers in that part of Asia – and not entirely because of China, because the Chinese will use this issue to try to keep Japan in a kind of de-legitimized position, but the key thing for the administration was Korea, a U.S. ally and one we want to be doing more with Japan and ourselves jointly.  And so it was – the subtext was can the prime minister move the dial with Korea.

Korean Americans protested when he was speaking, but I think most people who follow this thought the prime minister went pretty far.  He did not apologize, because I think in his view Japan has apologized a lot.  If you Google “Japan apology World War II,” it’s several pages of official apologies.  And I think Abe and his government view the apology as a political act designed to keep Japan wedded to a more constrained role.

But what he did do was use some new language to express his remorse.  In the congressional speech he used the word “with deep repentance.”  Repentance in a Christian tradition is loaded with a lot of meaning, more than remorse, which is a more passive way of expressing views on wrongdoing in the past.  I think a lot of people will pick up on that word, “repentance,” as new.  He spent a lot of the speech – I think six paragraphs – about history with the U.S. and with Asia.  And in his press conference and meeting at Harvard, he expressed his heartfelt sorrow at the fate of the so-called “comfort women,” women who were recruited to serve as prostitutes for the Imperial Japanese Army, very sensitive issue in Korea.

My sense is this is about as much as the administration expected – maybe not what they wanted, but about what they expected.  As I said, it’s not an issue, generally, for the rest of Asia, and the key will be how Korea reacts officially and if there will be a lot of Korean media criticism.  And the hope, I think, would be that this moves Korea-Japan relations forward a bit, even if it doesn’t completely resolve the very, very sensitive past between those countries.

Matt?

&nbsp;

MATTHEW P. GOODMAN:  Sure.  This is Matt Goodman.

Just to talk for a moment about TPP, as Mike said, this was one of the other big points of interest in this visit, and – this Trans-Pacific Partnership being negotiated among 12 countries in the Asia-Pacific.  The U.S. and Japan are by far the biggest members of the group.  And in a sense, this agreement is really a bilateral FTA, a free-trade agreement, between the U.S. and Japan, something that has been accomplished with other members of the group, among other members of the group.  But the U.S. and Japan is by far the biggest prize here.

The hope had been that the U.S. and Japan would be able to wrap up an agreement bilaterally on market access as a side negotiation to the main TPP 12 negotiations by the time of this trip.  That didn’t happen, and that’s disappointing to some.  But in fact, it’s clear from the body language of the two leaders that they got very close.  The negotiators are very close.  They said we made significant progress.  And importantly, they highlighted the fact that the two countries are now going to work on the other 10 members of the group to try to get the overall deal across the line.  And I think the signaling there is that a lot of the other countries in the group have been using the kind of excuse of the U.S. and Japan not having completed their part of the deal for not putting their final offers on the table.  And so now the U.S. and Japan are signaling, look, we’re all but done and we just need to get the others on board and get this thing wrapped up, possibly, you know, even within a matter of weeks or – you know, it’s always dangerous to predict when trade agreements are actually going to close, but the idea is that there is now momentum behind this.  Together with the movement of Trade Promotion Authority, or fast-track authority, in Congress, as that moves forward, that’s also given some momentum to the talks.  Again, other countries are waiting for that, including Japan, and now that that’s moving I think there’s a sense that this could be brought together.

Obviously, still not all issues between the U.S. and Japan have been fully resolved.  Agriculture or automobile issues remain to be tied up, and then in the broader agreement there are a number of issues that are still to be resolved.  And obviously TPP – TPA has to be completed.  So this isn’t a done deal yet.

But the sense, I think, is that this gives another big push to the overall talks.  And again, TPP is really not only a huge economic agreement between in particular the U.S. and Japan, and then bringing in 10 other Asian-Pacific countries, but is also strategically very significant for both the U.S. and Japan in terms of embedding themselves in the region as leaders of a rules-based order and simply updating the rules, which are really out of date with the realities of global trade and regional trade.  So it was essentially significant progress, but not yet done.

GREEN: Thanks, Colm. I think we can take questions for about 15, 20 minutes if there are some and if people can still hear us.

Q:  Hello, Colm?

Q:  This is –

Q:  Go ahead.

Q:  This is Angela Greiling Keane with Bloomberg.  Thanks for doing the call.

On the – two questions – one for each of you guys, I guess.  On the auto component of the TPP talks, obviously, Japan wants lower tariffs for Japanese vehicles imported in the U.S. and they’re working the language on that, but Japan already has low tariffs on American cars going over there, but yet nobody in Japan really buys American cars or any foreign cars to speak of.  Is there a way to satisfy the U.S. auto industry on that?

And then secondly, on comfort women, does anybody have any sense of how much that was discussed, and what sort of wording was used if it was, during the bilat between the two leaders privately.

GOODMAN: Well, let me take the auto one first. This is Matt Goodman.

So, as you know and implied, automobile trade between the two countries has been a major point of contention in our bilateral relationship, also a major point of trade between our two countries, a significant amount of trade.  And I think the issues that are – that are remaining on the table really relate to questions of the U.S. – remaining tariff lines in the U.S., which exist still on automobiles, on trucks and on auto parts.

I think there’s – my sense is that there’s been a basic understanding on the automobile and truck tariffs and a – with a lengthy phase out that will be based on whatever’s agreed in the overall 12-party talks.  The auto parts tariff, which is 2 ½ percent, is still the issue in contention, and I think the – as I understand it, they – Japan is hoping that that will be phased out much more quickly.  But that’s the remaining issue here.

On the Japanese side, I think there is a sense that the Japanese market has been a difficult one to penetrate, but in terms of clear, identifiable obstacles, as you said, there are not high tariffs in Japan.  There are not any direct measures taken by the government to prevent American automobiles penetrating that market, and so some of this is legacy challenges in that market.  But certainly those are the things that I think are the final issues to be resolved, again, alongside the agricultural issues.

GREEN: I’m told by the Japanese delegation that when the prime minister was in Boston, after the question of comfort women was raised in his roundtable with students, that then over dinner with Secretary Kerry it was – the history issue broadly was a major topic of conversation. It was a subtext for the whole meeting.  (Coughs.)  After the whole visit – excuse me – the prime minister went to the Holocaust Museum.  He went to the Lincoln Memorial with the famous “with malice toward none” speech on one wall.  And so I think it was a subtext for the entire visit.

I don’t get the feeling that the administration was heavy handed or that the Japanese felt it was heavy handed, in part because this has been a dialogue that’s been going on for as long as Prime Minister Abe’s been in charge, and in part because I think the administration recognizes that the Japanese have apologized.  The important thing was to reiterate the official apology, which the prime minister did in his speech to Congress.

And then the Korean side is somewhat divided.  The civil society movements want compensation and apology, a personal apology to each of the surviving comfort women.  The Korean government recognizes, I think, that that’s not going to happen because their bilateral treaty waived reparations.  And so President Park has wanted some statement of sincerity on this issue.  And the prime minister reiterating in front of Congress that he will stick with the previous apologies and talking about in his Harvard and his press availability his heartfelt remorse and repentance and so forth, my guess would be that the administration will tell the Korean side, look, it’s not everything you wanted, but this is a basis at least for moving forward, because the two leaders have not had a formal meeting.  And this, in spite of the fact Abe’s had two bilaterals with Xi Jinping of China and President Park of Korea has offered to have a bilateral with Kim Jong-un of North Korea.

So I think the administration probably think they have enough to not resolve the issue, but encourage a summit meeting, encourage some more progress between Japan and Korea, including some important defense and trade agreements we need them to cooperate on.

Q:  I was wondering – can I ask a question now.

GREEN: Please.

Q:  Yeah, this is David Brunnstorm from Reuters.

This is a question really for Mike and Nick.  On the guidelines, just wondering what potential difference you see the guidelines making in the South China Sea, and whether or not whatever comes of greater cooperation between Japan and the United States there would – you know, can act as a deterrent against China.

GREEN: It’s a good question because the Chinese – the PLA Navy and the Chinese Coast Guard has rough parity with the Japanese. And when it’s the U.S. and Japan it’s – we have a – still have a pretty strong advantage in terms of fire power and numbers of ships and quality of ships.

But when you line up the PLA Navy or just the Coast Guard against Vietnam or the Philippines, it isn’t even close.  The Philippines have four ships, and really only two of them are ocean-going.  And the Chinese have dozens and dozens – you know, last summer they deployed over a hundred in support of their mobile oil platform to keep the Vietnamese at bay.  Many of those were former PLA frigates that were painted white.

So the U.S. and Japan have clearly identified in this process that the vulnerability of these other states, even though they’re not all treaty allies, is a problem for us because the Chinese will, in the old proverb, kill the chicken to scare the monkey.  They’ll start undermining the credibility of the American security commitment and of Japan’s ability to deal with China as they, you know, start picking off the smaller powers.

So I think you will see in the defense guidelines that Japan would be more willing to provide logistical and other rear-air support for the U.S.  The U.S. doesn’t want to go into a war-fighting stance, but when we do what we call freedom of navigation exercises, send our ships through to show that we can, that China’s not sealed up this area as their lake, I think you’ll see more visible Japanese support for that.

And I think you’ll see a lot more shared capacity building, where the Japanese use changes in their development assistance charter to provide funding to help countries in the region have better maritime domain awareness, better airports and ports so that they are a little more in control of their own affairs.  But in terms of war-fighting or military stances, I think the U.S. and Japan are going to, you know, try to use as many non-military options as possible.

Q:  I mean, just to follow up, I mean, do you think it has the potential to change the equation?  Obviously China is steaming ahead while this – you know, these guidelines were being discussed and sort of et cetera.  And they still need to get some legislation in Japan.  And meanwhile, you know, more and more reefs are being developed.

GREEN: You know, it’s a really good question. And my hunch is that it is not enough.  It’s necessary, but not sufficient, that the Chinese ambitions are not being deterred or dissuaded by this yet.  It’s an important pillar that probably is long overdue, but there are other dimensions that are critical.  Building the capacity of these countries to be more resilient, to control their airspace and their maritime space, or at least to have domain awareness, as it’s called, to know who’s coming in and out of these hundreds and hundreds of Philippine Islands or in the South China Sea.

It’s going to take diplomatic efforts to back up ASEAN in the Southeast Asian – Association of South East Asian Nations.  Just yesterday the Chinese were able, through proxy members of ASEAN, to break up a consensus on supporting the Philippines diplomatically.  So it’s going to be a diplomatic game.  There’s a – the Chinese are using mercantile tools, banana embargos.  You can take them to the World Trade Organization and 18 months later, when the crisis has passed, you might be a result.

So this is going to be an all-of-government effort.  This – these new defense guidelines are not primarily about the South China Sea, but they do add an important pillar of the strategy.  But I think this is one the next president’s going to be dealing with.  And TPP will help, if we get it.  And I think, in my own view, we’re going to need more defense spending.  We’re going to need resources.

The Pentagon has made that clear, that they need more resources to deal with this problem.  And I think that Congress is willing to support it on balance, but the administration has not yet put together a comprehensive strategy.  So we’ll be dealing with this in the next presidency.

Q:  Thank you.

Q:  Geoff Dyer at the FT here.

Quick question for Mike, just on how Congress viewed the speech.  I mean, just how sensitive are they to these history issues and how do you think it will have played?  Will it have pleased or disappointed?

GREEN: Mike Honda from California, who has a large number of Korean-American constituents and has been active on the comfort women’s plight for a long time, issued a statement saying he was not happy and asking – saying the prime minister’s going to have to do more. I think that’s very much the exception, though, and not the rule.  I’ve in advance of the visit had a chance, so has Matt, to speak with some of the ranking members and to testify.  And my sense is there’s pretty robust support for Japan.

I think there’s a uniform feeling in the Congress that they need Japan’s help to reconcile with Korea.  It’s important for many of them, because they have Korean-American constituencies.  And for the ones who follow the Asia-Pacific, they know that this tension between Seoul and Tokyo is a strategic problem for us, even on the trade side, because of course the expectation is at some point that Koreans will dock into TPP.

Looking at the room and having talked to a lot of the – not a lot, but some of the key members interested in Asia beforehand, I think the prime minister did what he had to do.  I think he was well-received, with the exception of Mike Honda and, we’ll see, maybe one or two others who raise a legitimate issue, the comfort women issue.  But I think overall, very well-received.

Q:  Kiyon Kuk with the Segye Times.

Is question for Mike.  What’s the best option for Park Geun-hye administration of South Korea given the situation that Mr. Abe keeps, you know, resist to the pressure to apologize for the wartime atrocity, including comfort women issue?

GREEN: Well, you know, I – let me put it this way. If the Park government had a best chance on this issue, it was this week in Washington, because the U.S.-Japan alliance is so central to the Japanese government’s political standing and standing in the region that this was the time.  And what you heard from the prime minister in terms of reiterating his commitment to the previous apologies, his new language about repentance and deep remorse is, I think, the most that the Park government is likely to get out of Tokyo.

And so if it’s not enough for President Park to satisfy the Korean people, the question is, is it enough to at least make some modest progress on issues of mutual interest.  And I think the prevailing feeling here in Washington is that hopefully it should, that – you know, that President Park and Li Keqiang, the premier in China, and Abe are supposed to have some time this year a trilateral, that it should be enough for that and for a meeting between President Park and Prime Minister Abe, that the dialogue between Japan and Korean is not over on the comfort women issue, that there should be some more room for progress there going forward.

And of course, the actual statement on the 70<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the war is in August – August 15<sup>th</sup>.  And I think Korea has a basis for continuing to encourage Japan to do and say more.  But I think it would – it would be – there will be no progress in Japan-Korea relations if Seoul waits until after August 15<sup>th</sup>.  I think the expectation in Washington, in the administration, is that there needs to be some incremental progress, at least.  And then hopefully that will build momentum for more progress after the – for a better statement on August 15<sup>th</sup> and more progress after that.  But in terms of an apology, I personally don’t see Prime Minister Abe going much beyond what he said in Congress.

Q:  Hi.  This is Jeremy from The Straits Times of Singapore.

Mike, can I just ask you what do you think the message was for – from this visit to China?  And what do you think China’s reaction will be?

GREEN: I think the message – the TPP message to China’s important. And Matt should speak to that, because this is important – an important development in our economic relationship with China.

On the security side, I think this sends a message that the U.S. Japan alliance is indivisible.  You know, earlier in this second term senior Obama administration officials were embracing Xi Jinping’s proposal for a new model of great power relations between the U.S. and China.  And the Japanese protested.  India and other governments protested because the formulation does not include Japan as a great power.  It’s the U.S., China and Russia – and sometimes the EU.

So there were some, I think, expectations, perhaps, in Beijing that they could, you know, manipulate the alliance in a way to sort of weaken the mutual trust, to sort of elevate the U.S.-China relationship to a higher level and therefore have more leverage on Japan on the Senkakus.  I don’t think Beijing thinks that anymore.  I think this summit and the defense guidelines and TPP show how the U.S.-Japan alliance is really central to our approach to Asia.  And that’s very important strategically.  And the TPP part is not insignificant.

GOODMAN: Yeah. You know – as you know, the Chinese view of TPP has evolved over time.  They were – initially, I think, thought it was just a small insignificant thing.  Then they thought it was containment of China.  And it was actually just about at the time when Japan joined TPP in, you know, early 2013 that China’s view of TPP really flipped.  That was also the time there was a new administration coming in in Beijing.  And I think the – what changed in Beijing was they saw TPP as a potential tool to help drive their domestic reform.  And anyway, it was happening and it was where the rules were being written and they needed to understand and maybe be part of it in some way.

And so I think this progress this week, while it didn’t resolve the issue and therefore I think China’s still going to have some doubts about whether this is actually going to happen – as, in a sense, we all do – but now that it looks like this is closer I think China’s going to starting to talk about and think about themselves how they get involved in this – in this new sort of rules – system of rules in the region.  So that’s the – I think that’s the good news, because it’s intended to sort of incentivize them to want to be part of this conversation, and not to exclude them, as many people think.

You know, it’s true that some of these statements that the president and others in the administration are using to try to sell TPP domestically may sound a little scratchy to China, because there’s talk about, you know, writing the rules before China writes the rules.  I think a lot of that has to be discounted as part of the domestic political debate.

But you know, there is something about the fact that the U.S. and Japan have a pretty clear and common agreement on what high-standard rules mean in things like intellectual property and the role of the state and the economy and regulate – good regulatory policy and labor and environmental standards.  And it’s important for the U.S. and Japan to really nail those things and be the champions of those things in the region.  And I’m sure China – you know, China is listening to that.

GREEN: You know, the Chinese were very unhappy and protested when President Obama last year in April in Tokyo said that the U.S.-Japan alliance, specifically Article 5 of the alliance, would apply to the Senkakus because they’re under the territorial control of Japan. And then in November, Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Abe had a summit.  And last week, Xi and Abe had a summit as well, and a rather positive summit.  And the Chinese knew full-well these defense guidelines were coming.  Nothing in it was surprising.

So I think a steady and consistent demonstration that the U.S.-Japan alliance is strong and is not going to be picked apart or replaced by a new model of great power relations or G-2 is really essential for the U.S. and Japan to have productive diplomacy with China.  And if you look back in history, the presidents who put Japan at the center – Ronald Reagan in particular, but when Clinton did this at certain points and President Bush – we always had more productive U.S.-China relations after.

The problem is when we – when it’s unclear where we stand.  And when, you know, American affection is something that the big powers compete for.  When it’s clear we stand by Japan as a maritime power, a democracy, an ally, the host of our major overseas forces and the second-largest contributor to the international financial institutions – when that’s clear and we’re unequivocal about it, U.S. China relations tend to stabilize and improve.

So I think this will, in the short term, perhaps, elicit some unhappiness from Beijing, but will probably contribute to more productive U.S.-China relations, including when Xi Jinping comes in September.

I think we’re going to wrap up.  If this was useful – if this was useful let Colm know, because we’ll try to do this when President Park comes in June and when President Xi comes in September.  And if it wasn’t useful, let Colm know and he just won’t tell us.  (Laughter.)  Is that right, Colm?  We good?

QUINN: That’s all of our time. Thanks a lot, you guys.  If there’s any follow up you guys need, you guys have my email:  cquinn@csis.org.  And please get in touch with me if you have anything more, but I hope this was useful for you guys.

GREEN: And we’re putting out a sort of new analysis of the speech in about half an hour, which goes into a bit more detail.

QUINN: All right. So watch your inboxes for that.  Thanks a lot, you guys.  And we will be posting the audio to this on our website later on as well, along with a transcript, for anyone who needs it.

OK, thanks a lot.

Q:  Thank you.

Q:  Thank you.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://amti.csis.org/island-tracker/">China’s reclamation activities</a> in the South China Sea remain a matter of grave concern for reasons that are not solely political. The radical transformation of major coral atolls in the region’s marine ecosystem affects far more than the already huge area physically occupied by China’s new islands. The biophysical impacts extend well beyond their artificial foundations into the waters of surrounding littoral states.

The Spratly Islands region has long been known as a treasure trove of biological resources, hosting part of Southeast Asia’s most productive coral reef ecosystems. Fish breed and replenish in its reefs and migrate across vast distances to and from littoral coasts as they follow plankton and other organisms adrift in the water. Satellites can discern the <a href="http://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/11778674.pdf">circulation</a> of <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5278318&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5278318">plankton-rich seawater around the South China Sea</a>, indicating biological connections throughout the waters. (Fig. 1) These “Dangerous Grounds” ironically are a wellspring of life that helps sustain the marine populations of surrounding coasts.

The Philippines is particularly sensitive to these events due to heightened environmental awareness of its coastal communities that directly depend on fishing for subsistence. The closest province of Palawan is quite special in this regard as the country’s final ecological frontier: its waters are its most productive fishing ground, contributing 20% of <a href="http://www.bfar.da.gov.ph/publication">annual fish production</a>. <a href="http://scholarlyrepository.miami.edu/oa_dissertations/157/">Studies</a> have also confirmed genetic linkages and interchange of species between the Spratly Islands region, Palawan waters, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00637.x/abstract">and the Sulu Sea</a>, (Fig. 2) which in turn connects with all other archipelagic waters and Southeast Asia’s <a href="http://coralmagazine-us.com/content/no-reef-island-long-distance-dispersal-network-coral-and-fish-larvae-found">Coral Triangle</a>.

Dr. Edgardo Gomez of the Marine Science Institute, one of the most-respected marine scientists of the region and pioneer in the scientific cooperation activities in the 1990s, <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/90878-china-west-philippine-sea-reclamation-fisheries-food-security">laments the destruction of 311 hectares of precious reefs and pegs the economic losses to be worth at least 110 Million USD annually</a>, to be surely felt as reduction in fish catch in the coming decades. He points out that the ecological footprint of China’s reclamation spans more than the ground that the new islands stand on. While formerly productive reefs have been replaced with lifeless sand and concrete, the months of work to create each island also smothered surrounding areas through sedimentation and turbidity produced by dumping massive amounts of filling material. To bury the reef, these were siphoned off from surrounding areas, indicating disturbance and destruction of benthic communities either around the new island or elsewhere. Natural atolls will be dredged and become artificial harbors for the many ships to be stationed in the area, bringing with them the corresponding impact of continuous operational marine pollution on any remaining coral.

Settlement on the new islands will bring ruin through accompanying day-to-day activities such as sewage, garbage, anchoring, and marine debris. People will require a continuous supply of food most likely to be harvested from nearby waters. To top this off, <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/10/chinese-fishermen-in-troubled-waters/">China is deploying and operating its ravenous fishing fleet</a>. Chinese fishing has already caused the <a href="http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-10-00172.1">destruction of its southern coastal reefs</a> and decline of coastal fish stocks; no doubt it will also cause the rapid decline of these distant fishing grounds.

The impact zone of China’s activities thus extend well beyond the South China Sea: reefs directly destroyed, surrounding areas damaged, fish stocks of connected waters deprived of precious breeding grounds and habitats. The island-building spree and fishing fleet mobilization result not only in the deliberate destruction of vital and productive commons-- they also impair the long-term sustainability of the marine environment of all the littoral States around the South China Sea.

While China argues that island-building is “reasonable, understandable, and legal,” the large-scale and irreparable damage wrought contravenes the fundamental principle that states’ activities should not cause trans-boundary harm to other states. This applies not only to incidental effects like pollution, but with even more force to activities that are purposely planned and executed, especially in areas where disputing states are additionally obliged not cause permanent damage pending settlement. China’s action, undertaken on such a massive scale, significantly damages the marine environment of the South China Sea and surrounding waters, and heralds the further degradation and depletion of their living resources. China’s own marine scientists have previously called attention to the decline of sensitive coral reefs in the South China Sea <a href="http://www.livescience.com/25870-china-coral-reefs.html">by as much as 80%</a> due to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23140101">ravenous economic exploitation</a>; with reclamation, the remaining 20% stand to be lost as well.

Thus, there is some truth to China’s claim that the reclamation activities “are not directed against any state”: the long-term damage done is indiscriminate and undirected, making it much worse. In attempting to exclusively secure and control natural resources, it is also destroying the most fragile and sensitive marine resource base of the South China Sea and diminishing everyone else’s.  It has engaged in environmental aggression on a regional scale, and turned reclamation into a environmental weapon of mass destruction.

		<title>South China Sea: Forging a Maritime Coalition of the Willing</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[China’s expansive and accelerated construction activities in the South China Sea have elicited growing criticism from across the region and beyond. While some countries, particularly Vietnam and the Philippines, are primarily worried over the impact of China’s reclamation activities on their maritime claims in the area, other countries, from Singapore to Japan and the United States (U.S.), are particularly concerned over freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea.

During the recently-concluded Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit, regional leaders <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-28/asean-leaders-concerned-over-south-china-sea-land-reclamations">expressed their concern</a> over how China’s reclamation activities “has eroded trust and confidence and may undermine [authors’ emphasis] <em>peace, security and stability in the South China Sea</em>.” It was an unusually strongly-worded statement <a href="http://www.shanghaidaily.com/article/article_xinhua.aspx?id=279033">to reaffirm</a> the regional body’s commitment to “maintaining peace, stability, security and freedom of navigation in and over-flight over the South China Sea."

President Obama was even blunter in his reaction, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/10/obama-says-china-bullying-smaller-nations-in-south-china-sea-row">accusing China</a> of violating international norms and “using its sheer size and muscle to force countries into subordinate positions.” Concerned over potential threats to unimpeded navigation and trade across the South China Sea, a Japanese official went <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/29/us-usa-japan-southchinasea-idUSKBN0NK15M20150429">so far as warning</a>: "We have to show China that it doesn't own the sea." Beyond rhetorical condemnations, the real challenge, however, is to devise an effective, multilateral strategy to alter China’s behavior, particularly its decision to swiftly build facts on the waters at the expense of regional security.

The ASEAN should seriously contemplate the option of <a href="http://www.rsis.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CO15094.pdf">joint peacekeeping patrols</a> in the South China Sea, possibly with American logistical support, and push for the expeditious conclusion of a Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea. Thanks to their <a href="http://amti.csis.org/the-maritime-security-implications-of-the-new-u-s-japan-guidelines/">newly revised bilateral defense guidelines</a>, the U.S. and Japan, meanwhile, can also jointly pursue more robust counter-provocation measures in the area,

<strong>China’s Belligerence </strong>

China’s actions don’t only violate the <a href="http://www.asean.org/asean/external-relations/china/item/declaration-on-the-conduct-of-parties-in-the-south-china-sea">2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties</a> (DOC), which discourages claimant states from unilaterally altering the status quo, but also international law, which bars the <a href="http://amti.csis.org/island-tracker/">permanent alteration</a> of <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1477352">disputed features</a>.

China has left limited room for a peaceful and diplomatic resolution of the disputes. Unwilling to be bound by any legalistic document, China has <a href="http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/focus/05/07/14/experts-see-china-foot-dragging-south-china-sea-code">repeatedly dragged its foot</a> on negotiating even just the guidelines of a COC in the South China Sea, constantly advising patience while swiftly building facts on the ground.  China has also <a href="http://amti.csis.org/arbitration-101-philippines-v-china/">consistently opposed third party arbitration</a> of the maritime disputes in the area, effectively nullifying international law -- and arbitration bodies under its aegis -- as a potential avenue for the resolution of the disputes.

Moreover, by conducting ever-expanding para-military patrols, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-submarine-fleet-adds-nuclear-strike-capability-altering-strategic-balance-undersea-1414164738">deploying nuclear submarines</a>, and establishing large-scale airstrips and garrisons in adjacent waters, China has transformed largely symbolic sovereignty spats into an increasingly militarized territorial showdown. Ironically, all of this is happening during the “<a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1249761.shtml">Year of China-ASEAN Maritime Cooperation</a>”.

Leveraging its <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/chinas-plan-obliterate-american-supremacy-12577">economic preponderance</a> in the region, China has shown little patience for any kind of criticism from its Southeast Asian counterparts. In response to ASEAN’s statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman accused an "individual country" [Read: the Philippines] of hijacking ASEAN’s agenda by “regionalizing” supposedly purely bilateral disputes, while dubiously criticizing some ASEAN countries <u>for</u> “carrying out reclamations on the Chinese islands [the Spratlys]…” China doesn’t even recognize the claims of other countries as well as the self-evidently multilateral nature of its maritime disputes with several neighboring countries.

<strong>A Multilateral Maritime Response in the South China Sea</strong>

Overeager to benefit from China’s economic largesse, ASEAN has collectively failed to ensure that greater economic engagement with China goes hand in hand with stable, rule-based security relations in the South China Sea. But ASEAN can still re-assert its relevance by moving forward on three fronts.

First, it should adopt an <a href="http://aseanec.blogspot.com/2011/10/putting-asean-x-to-work-for-aec.html">“ASEAN-X” decision-making formula</a> in the realm of maritime security in order to ensure the regional agenda is not held hostage by few veto-players (unduly influenced by China). Under this formula, which has been employed quite successfully in negotiating trade-related agreements within the ASEAN, Southeast Asian countries can move ahead with major decisions vis-à-vis the South China Sea based on the will of the majority. Since most ASEAN countries agree on the necessity of ensuring freedom of navigation, preventing further escalation, and resolution of the territorial spats based on international law in the disputed waters, there is greater hope for a diplomatic breakthrough under an alternative decision making principle.

Second, the regional body should move ahead with at least establishing a Code of Conduct among its own members, then pressure China and other external powers to sign up. While it is preferable that any COC applies to all members regarding all territorial and maritime-related issues in the region, it would be wise and more expedient to at least start with common rules of the road among South China Sea (active) claimant states such as Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. (This was more or less how ASEAN advocated and mainstreamed the <a href="http://www.mid.ru/bdomp/spm_md.nsf/0/526c1ca9214cfd57c3257d8d00303839/$FILE/TAC-text.pdf">Treaty of Amity and Cooperation</a>.)

Lastly, ASEAN members should seriously consider joint peacekeeping patrols in the South China Sea, a measure that has been <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/malaysia-plans-peacekeeping-force-for-south-china-sea-1426687959">endorsed by the current ASEAN chairman, Malaysia</a>. The concept was <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-18/u-s-navy-urges-joint-southeast-asia-patrols-of-south-china-sea">originally proposed</a> by Vice Admiral Robert Thomas, commander of the US 7th Fleet, who stated the U.S. Navy is willing to <a href="http://news.usni.org/2015/03/20/u-s-7th-fleet-would-support-asean-south-china-sea-patrols">provide necessary support</a> for multilateral peacekeeping patrols in the South China Sea. Since 2004, several ASEAN members (i.e., Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Singapore) have participated in Malacca Strait Patrols (MSP), collectively guarding a key international waterway against maritime piracy and other threats. So there is quasi-precedence.

To support efforts at ensuring freedom of navigation in the area, American defense officials have also <a href="http://news.usni.org/2015/03/09/essay-u-s-should-consider-establishing-a-south-china-sea-international-operations-center-in-indonesia">proposed</a> the establishment of an International Maritime Operations Center (IMOC) in Indonesia, which could provide necessary support for multilateral patrol operations in the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean. A potentially game-changing development, however, is the growing indication that Japan, equipped with Asia’s most modern navy, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/29/us-usa-japan-southchinasea-idUSKBN0NK15M20150429">might soon join the fray</a>.

Earlier this year, certain American defense officials, namely Vice Admiral Thomas,  <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-04/japan-to-consider-expanding-navy-patrols-to-south-china-sea">requested</a> Japanese Marine Self Defense Forces (MSDF) to contribute to joint patrols in the South China Sea. Deeply worried by the prospect of a Chinese <em>de facto</em> domination of and possible imposition of <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/01/chinas-drafting-a-south-china-sea-adiz/">an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ)</a> in the area, the Abe administration could leverage the <a href="http://amti.csis.org/the-maritime-security-implications-of-the-new-u-s-japan-guidelines/">new U.S.-Japan Defense Guidelines</a> to push for a more robust Japanese presence in the South China Sea.

Obviously, operationalizing any of these proposals risks huge domestic and international backlash. For starters, Japan will have to overcome stiff domestic resistance to any pro-active reassertion of Japanese <a href="http://amti.csis.org/the-u-s-japan-alliance-upgrades-and-maritime-contention-in-asia/">maritime prowess in international waters</a>, while China will certainly oppose multilateral cooperation between ASEAN, Japan, and the U.S. in the South China Sea disputes. Nevertheless, given the paucity of existing mechanisms, it is high time to consider bold, new measures to prevent a further deterioration in the regional maritime disputes.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Taiping Island:  An Island or a Rock under UNCLOS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In its Memorial and supplemental information submitted to the arbitral tribunal in <em>The Republic of the Philippines v. The People’s Republic of China</em>, the Philippines argues that all features in the Spratly archipelago are incapable of sustaining human habitation or economic life of their own. Even the largest feature in the Spratlys – Taiping Island (Itu Aba) – is a “rock”. Accordingly, Taiping Island cannot generate maritime entitlement to a 200 nautical miles, an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), or a continental shelf under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

Is Taiping Island an “island” or a “rock” under UNCLOS? Is Taiping Island capable of sustaining human habitation or economic life of its own? Is Taiping Island entitled the right to generate a 200 nm EEZ or a continental shelf? Is the Philippines’ argument well founded in fact and law? For the purpose of answering these questions, it is important to examine the facts about Taiping Island and discussing its legal status in accordance with Article 121of the UNCLOS.

Taiping Island, known in English as Itu Aba Island, in Chinese as Tàipíng Dǎo (literally: "peace island"), in Tagalog as Ligao, and in Vietnamese as Đảo Ba Bình, is the largest of the naturally occurring Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. The island is named in honor of a Nationalist Chinese Navy warship which sailed to the island in December 1946 after the Second World War. Under Article 2(f) of the 1951 San Francisco Treaty of Peace with Japan and Article 2 of the 1952 Treaty of Peace between the Republic of China and Japan, Japan renounced all right, title and claim to the Spratly Islands and to the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea. Since 1956, the island has continuously been administered by the Republic of China (Taiwan). Since February 1980, Taiping Island has been incorporated into the administration of Qijin District, Kaohsiung City of Taiwan.

The island has a long and narrow shape that is low and flat, approximately 1,290-meter long and 366-meter wide. The surface includes fine sand and coral reefs formed by weathering. Around the island are sandy beaches, with narrower 5-meter wide beaches on the south and north sides, on the east side 20 meters wide, and on the southwest side 50 meters wide. The island has diverse flora and fauna, and has historically been mined for phosphates to the point of depletion. Taiping’s waters may be suitable for fisheries and may hold potential oil and gas reserves. There has been no formal exploration or mining conducted thus far.

Taiping is the only island with fresh water in the Spratly archipelago. In 1992, a water catchment, reservoirs and other facilities were constructed. In 1993, two complete desalination machines were placed on the island, which operate for four hours each day, generating approximately 6,000 gallons of fresh water.

Prior to the use of solar power, facilities on the island were powered mainly by five 200 kW diesel generators; all fuel is shipped from the Taiwanese main island. Since December 2014, Taiping Island has been powered by a 40 kW photovoltaic power station that will generate an estimated 50MWh per year. The entire solar power system generates an estimated 189,492 kWh per year, saving an estimated 49,000 litres of diesel fuel per year. Taiwan’s policy goal is to develop Taiping Island as a low-carbon, environmentally sound island, to be used for peaceful purposes.

Taiping hosts a shelter for fishermen, a hospital, a post office, a Guanyin temple, weather stations, satellite telecommunications facilities, radar surveillance equipment and other communications equipment located on the island. There are five public telephones and internet connectivity. The southeast side of the island contains old Japanese constructions. The "Taiping Cultural Park" is located near an old pier that was damaged.

A 1,200-meter long, 30-meter wide runway was constructed on Taiping Island in late 2007. In February 2008, Taiwan’s then-president Chen Shui-bian landed on the island in an air force C-130 cargo plane to inaugurate the airstrip. There is also a large hard-standing area capable of accommodating two C-130 aircraft. The island has a helicopter platform that is not used frequently. There have been a number of plans to lengthen the runway.

Since there are many reefs around the island and the surrounding water is shallow, transportation and supply vessels are unable to dock on the island itself. Supplies are loaded on to rafts and taken to and from shore from an anchorage about 1.2 nm from the island—a difficult and time-consuming task due to the risk of large waves. Taiwan is currently undertaking several development project on the island, including building two new piers and access roads, which are to be completed by the end of 2015. Other projects include a lighthouse, navigation guidance and other auxiliary facilities, rain water drainage improvement, landing light repairs, and a refueling facility. In addition to national defense, humanitarian, and transportation purposes, the runway and piers will also be used in support of future economic development projects and activities.

Currently, a military supply ship services the island during a single voyage in April and November each year, anchoring for one day to deliver personnel and military supplies. Additionally, a civil merchantman arrives with general goods every 20 days. This ship is also used as a transport for stationed personnel and occasionally for scholars who conduct research on the island. In March 2008, then-presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou proposed in his ocean policy to establish a marine peace park in Taiping Island. Since 2011, Taiping Island has become an attractive visiting site for college students, teachers and researcher who participate in a study camp organized by Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense. The camp is intended to enhance awareness among young people of the importance of maritime strategy and security in the South China Sea.

At present, Taiping has a population of 200. This includes personnel from the Coast Guard Administration, soldiers from Navy and Air Force, and no civilians. Personnel are stationed on the island to safeguard sovereignty, national defense, security, and for environmental protection and law enforcement.

With these facts in hand, we can return to the application of Article to Taiping Island. Article 121 has following three paragraphs:
<ol>
	<li>An island is a naturally formed area of land, surrounded by water, which is above water at high tide.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
	<li>Except as provided for in paragraph 3, the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf of an island are determined in accordance with the provisions of this Convention applicable to other land territory.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
	<li>Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.</li>
</ol>
This article creates two categories of islands: (1) the islands that are capable of sustaining human habitation or economic life of their own, and therefore, just like other land territory, have a territorial sea, a contiguous zone, an EEZ, and a continental shelf; and (2) the islands that are incapable of sustaining human habitation or economic life of their own, and therefore are treated as “rocks.”

How should the article, in particular its third paragraph, be interpreted and applied to Taiping Island? According to Jon M. Van Dyke and Robert A. Brooks, Article 121 should be interpreted according to Article 31 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which provides for treaty interpretation in accordance with “good faith […] to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.” Because the purposes for establishing coastal EEZs cannot justify claims to EEZs around uninhabited islands situated far away from their coasts, Van Dyke and Brooks have argued that UNCLOS should note be applied to remote rocks or reefs to generate extended maritime zones. Accordingly, only if stable communities of people live on the island can islands generate maritime entitlements.

Van Dyke and Dale Bennett have argued that if a rock or reef cannot sustain human habitation permanently for at least 50 people, it cannot claim an EEZ or continental shelf. Other international legal scholars, including Northcut Ely, Arvid Pardo, Gilbert Gidel, and Robert D. Hodgson have expressed similar views. There is no doubt that Taiping Island is capable of sustaining human habitation permanently for more than 150 people.

Jonathan I. Charney has advocated a broader interpretation of Article 121(3). He argued that a rock is a kind of island, and that Article 121(3) would not be needed in the Convention if they were not. Article 121(3) uses “or” between “human habitation” and “economic life of their own,” and therefore it is only necessary to prove that a land feature can sustain either human habitation <em>or</em> economic activity of its own to be able to claim an EEZ or continental shelf.

After examining the <em>travaux preparatoires </em>of UNCLOS III, Charney reasoned that the habitation referred to in Article 121(3) need not be permanent in nature, and the economic activity need not be capable of sustaining a person throughout the year. Activity could include industry or exploration of the living or mineral resources in the territorial sea of the island or rock. Charney suggested that a feature is not subject to Article 121(3) if it has mineral resources such as oil or gas, harvestable fisheries, or is the location for a profitable business such as a casino, which could sustain an economy sufficient to support that activity through the purchase of necessities from external sources. He maintained that Article 121(3) should permits a finding of an economic life as long as the feature can generate revenues sufficient to purchase the missing necessities. Charney concluded that changes in circumstances might help rocksto obtain the legal status of islands and therefore have the right to generate EEZs and continental shelves.

Jonathan L. Hafetz has also argued that marine conservation constitutes an economic use within the meaning of Article 121(3), as conservation activities bring net economic benefits and sustainable development through the establishment of marine protected areas.

Although expert opinion on the number of Spratly features that qualify as islands under Article 121 of the UNCLOS varies, Mark J. Valencia, Jon M. Van Dyke, and Noel A. Ludwig suggest that between 25 and 35 of the 80-90 distinct features in the Spratly area are above water at high tide, and therefore they qualify as “islands” under Article 121 of the Convention. Taiping Island is the largest among these land features.

Robert Beckman and Clive H. Schofield suggest that because they all have vegetation, and in some cases roads and structures have been built on them, the following features are islands under UNCLOS: Taiping Island, Thitu Island, West York Island, Northeast Cay, Southwest Cay, Spratly Island, Namyit Island, Nansha(n) Island, Sand Cay, Loaita Island, Sin Cowe Island, and Amboyna Cay. In January 2010, the U.S. government released a South China Sea Map and Gazetteer, in which Taiping Island, along with other smaller features, are labelled as “islands.” More recently, BBC correspondent Bill Hayton wrote in his book that Taiping Island is “clearly able to support at least minimal human habitation.”

There are more writings of the highly qualified scholars in the field of the law of the sea that can be cited in support of the legal status of Taiping Island as an island under the UNCLOS. But the conclusion for this short essay is that in fact and law, there is no doubt that Taiping Island is capable of sustaining human habitation or that can have economic life of its own. Accordingly, this island is not a “rock” as referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 121 of the Convention. This means that Taiping Island is indeed an island and in accordance with Article 121(2), it can have EEZ and continental shelf.]]></content:encoded>

On Wednesday, May 13, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel and Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs David Shear testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on American interests in and strategy for the East and South China Seas.

Team AMTI has identified some choice moments from the hearing for maritime security watchers.  View the <strong>full video</strong> of their testimony above. <a href="http://www.foreign.senate.gov/download/051315_Russel_Testimony">Click here</a> to read testimony by <strong>Daniel Russel</strong>. <a href="http://www.foreign.senate.gov/download/051215_Shear_Testimony">Click here</a> to read testimony by <strong>David Shear</strong>.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">15:56</span> – </strong>Senator Corker dismissed Senator Cardin’s call to ratify UNCLOS. “China is a signatory to the Law of the Sea treaty and it doesn’t seem to be having a very positive effect,” Corker remarked.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>30:35</strong></span> – Assistant Secretary Shear averred “It’s our estimate that it’ll be 2017 to 2018 before the Chinese complete construction of the air field on Fiery Cross Reef.” This is a longer-dated estimate than many analysts have preferred, and is surprising given that <a href="http://amti.csis.org/fiery-cross-reef-tracker/">much of the Fiery Cross runway is already paved</a>.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">33:00</span> –</strong> Senator Corker asked if we have considered helping other claimants build out their outposts to counter China. Assistant Secretary Russel responded: “We discourage, not encourage, the construction of outposts or the reclamation or the construction of potential military facilities by any claimant on these islands and shoals… the problem is that the scale and scope of China’s reclamation activities combined with military activities put it in a different category.”

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">57:37</span> –</strong> Senator Murphy pushed Assistant Secretary Shear on the conditions that would trigger the U.S.-Philippines defense treaty. Shear repeated President Obama’s previous statement that the alliance is “ironclad” and insisted “we will keep that commitment.” Senator Murphy pushed further on whether there was any ambiguity on the <em>casus foederis </em>of the treaty. Shear replied: “I think that if Philippine forces came under attack, we would certainly confer urgently and intensively with our Philippine ally with a view to ensuring the safety and security of the Philippines.” Senator Murphy urged the need for clarity to avoid provocations in “grey zones.”

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">1:06:08</span> –</strong> Assistant Secretary Russel identified two major obstacles to U.S. security strategy in Asia. The first was uncertainty in Asian countries over whether the United States can complete the Trans Pacific Partnership, especially after this week’s wrangling over the Trade Promotion Authority. Russel averred that TPP is crucial to strengthening the United States’ position in Asia. He also stated that the Senate should ratify the Law of the Sea convention.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>1:10:12</strong> </span>– Senator Corker stated that he doesn’t think China is paying a price for its bad behavior. Assistant Secretary Russel “respectfully yet passionately” disagreed: “China is paying a price and it’s a growing price for its behavior… I cited the strong ASEAN pushback.” Pushed to give a tangible price for China Assistant Secretary Russel cited U.S. becoming a security guarantor for regional powers as an effect of Chinese provocation. Assistant Secretary Russel also stated that China has failed to silence criticism and legal proceedings in international forums and that regional powers are coming together to call out the Nine Dash-Line and enhance maritime monitoring.

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">1:17:10</span> –</strong> Senator Corker asked Assistant Secretary Shear about the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-military-proposes-challenge-to-china-sea-claims-1431463920">possibility of the United States conducting Freedom of Navigation (FON) operations</a> within 12 nautical miles of artificial Chinese features. Assistant Secretary Shear stated that he could not elaborate on classified operations in an unclassified briefing. Shear insisted that the United States has innocent passage in the areas in question, and that China pays close attention to our FON ops

Earlier in the hearing {<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>30:13</strong></span>}, Shear noted “Many of the features China and other claimants are building on are submerged features that do not generate territorial waters.”

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">1:39:06</span> –</strong> Senator Corker concluded the hearing by stating that he does not believe the United States has a coherent policy for engaging China in maritime Asia. “I leave here as disappointed as I was a year ago that we don’t have a policy,” he lamented.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Satellite imagery of the South China Sea has established  that over the previous twelve months, China has expanded its presence there by up to 1500 acres. The Chinese have been actively reclaiming land at the following reefs: Cuarteron, Fiery Cross, Gaven, Hughes, Subi, and the Union reefs (Johnson South and Johnson North reefs). One perspective on this activity is that it represents straightforward, aggressive Chinese expansionism, requiring a robust response. Alas, the situation is far more complex than this view suggests, and the policy response needs to take this into account. A few points merit highlighting.

First, it is not entirely clear that any international law has been violated. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Daniel Russel recently noted that Chinese “reclamation isn't necessarily a violation of international law, but it’s certainly violating the harmony, the <em>fengshui</em> of Southeast Asia, and, its certainly violating China’s claim to be a good neighbor and a benign and non-threatening power.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Russel’s point is good counsel to the Chinese to ease up. However, one struggles to think of empirical examples to buttress his point. It is exceedingly rare for states on the periphery of any great power to view their neighbour as benign and non-threatening. Certainly, claims in the 1998-2008 period that China was viewed by its Asian neighbours as  benign and unthreatening are now viewed as a far from accurate analysis.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>

Second, whatever the final solution is to this issue, it will have to, in some measure, incorporate a rising China’s concerns. To expect otherwise is an illusion. So, what is China’s perspective? Beijing maintains  that it respects the principle of freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> At the same time, the Chinese not unreasonably claim that they are merely doing what all states do, namely, defend state sovereignty. In the process, China views itself as having exercised restraint. Sheng Dingli, a Professor at Fudan University in Shanghai recently noted that ”the Chinese government has restrained itself. Our islands are still controlled by others, but we are not using force to take them back.”<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>

Third, let’s be honest with ourselves. China is hardly the only state that has been busy at the reclamation game. One can easily envisage Chinese officials explaining to Secretary Kerry during his Beijing visit last weekend, that China is  merely responding to the actions of other states, in a general scramble for territory. More specifically, they will have pointed to reclamation activity of other states that occurred <em>prior</em> to the recent Chinese activity. Since August 2011, Vietnam has reclaimed 200,000 square meters of land in the Spratly Islands section of the  South China Sea. Also, since April 2014, Taiwan has also reclaimed land in its South China  outpost of Itu Aba Island. These  claimants may appeal to our sense of fair play, pointing to the obvious disparity between themselves and China, both in state size and the resources available to enforce claims. On that score, our sympathies are surely with them. But, when has such logic ever been accepted as an argument against any state which is acting to secure its territorial claims against competing claimants?

Wherever one stands in the debate, what is <em>not</em> in doubt is that the status quo <em>has</em> been modified in ways that heightens the potential for more conflict. Not surprisingly, the U.S. is clear on who is responsible for this. Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Admiral Harry Harris has been quoted as saying that “China is creating a great wall of sand with dredges and bulldozers.”<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Indeed, in recent testimony before a Senate Committee, the Commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, Admiral Samuel Locklear characterized  China’s pace of construction in the  South  China Sea as “astonishing.”<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> He further posited that “if this activity continues at pace, it will give them (China) defacto control of the maritime territory they claim.”<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> Locklear also speculated that this “might be a platform if they (China) ever wanted, to establish an air defence zone” in the South China Sea.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>

These views have not gone unchallenged by China, which equally unsurprisingly, views itself as defensive, and other claimants as adopting an offensive posture. In a speech in Washington DC on 16 April this year, China’s ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai, concisely laid out Beijing’s view on the South China Sea.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> First, China will defend its sovereignty and maritime rights, even while it exercises restraint. Second, China seeks to resolve disputes through diplomacy. Third, on the specific issue of the upgrading of Chinese facilities in the South China Sea, this activity is “well within China’s sovereignty.”<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> Finally, China’s overall foreign policy is “defensive in nature.”<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> Therefore, in seeking to resolve the South China Sea disputes, Beijing seeks to co-operate with all regional states, and “particularly with the U.S.”<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>

Yet, slightly more than a week later, there was little co-operation on display from China’s Southeast Asian neighbours. At the late April 2015 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit in Kuala Lumpur, ASEAN Secretary General Le Luong Minh contested China’s South China Sea claims. Asked about a recent Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson’s unusually blunt criticism of his alleged lack of neutrality on this issue, Minh responded: “What kind of neutrality are they talking about? Can I be neutral to ASEAN interests? How can I be neutral to the truth?”<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a> Positions appear to be hardening rather than softening. Thus, during Secretary Kerry’s recent Beijing trip, his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi expressed the view that “China’s determination to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity is as firm as a rock and is unshakable.”<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> Wang added that “we also hope to maintain peace and stability in the region and are committed to international freedom of navigation.”<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> Whether the duality present in China’s views is in fact reconcilable (or not) with regional stability is a question that the region will now have to confront.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The U.S. Navy has released video of a P-8A flight over China’s artificial islands in the South China Sea. Some of this video has been released via a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/20/politics/south-china-sea-navy-flight/index.html">CNN exclusive</a>, but it also includes additional, stunning footage of aerial patrols in the Spratlys.  In these video clips, sailors assigned to Patrol Squadron (VP) 45 conduct flight operations aboard a P-8A Poseidon over the South China Sea. During the flight, the crew of the P-8A documented several warnings, issued by China's People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), to leave the area.

A handwritten transcript shown by one of the communications officers in the video reads:

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chinese facility</span>: <em>"Foreign military airplane you are approaching my military secure ... please go away quickly in order to (indiscernable)... Station calling U.S. military aircraft, please identify yourself."</em>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">P-8A Poseidon</span>: <em>"I am a United States military aircraft conducting lawful military activities acting outside national airspace. I am with due regard in accordance with international law."</em>

The mission documented the continued expansion of reefs which have been turned into man-made islands with airport infrastructure in the South China Sea. Dozens of dredgers and naval craft are visible operating within the lagoons and harbors of Subi Reef, Mischief Reef, and Fiery Cross Reef. VP-45 is on deployment supporting U.S. 7th Fleet operations in the Pacific.

		<title>Taiwan’s Evolving Position in the South China Sea— And Why Other Actors Should Take Notice</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Taiwan, along with China and four Southeast Asian countries, is a claimant in the South China Sea, though this fact is sometimes overlooked, despite it occupying the largest natural land feature in the South China Sea (Taiping Island or Itu Aba). On paper, Taiwan and China appear to be making substantially the same claims. The dashed or U-shaped line encapsulating much of the South China Sea appears on both Taiwanese and Chinese maps.

Neither China nor Taiwan has officially clarified the meaning of the dashed line which could be seen as making a claim to the wide expanse of water enclosed within the dashed line or (merely) to the land features contained therein and to maritime zones made from them in accordance with UNCLOS and international law.

In the past year, however, Taiwan has taken small but significant steps toward clarifying that its claims are from land and in accord with UNCLOS and international law. For instance, President Ma Ying-jeou affirmed in a speech in September 2014 that “the principle that ‘sovereignty over land determines ownership of the surrounding waters,’ which is set out in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, applies to disputes concerning sovereignty over both land and sea.” Taiwan has also adopted a more conciliatory position by advocating that its East China Sea Peace Initiative, which urges parties to shelve disputes and promote joint exploration and development in the East China Sea (where China, Taiwan and Japan have competing claims), be applied in the South China Sea as well.

Such moves are significant in that they could have a stabilizing effect in the South China Sea. The PRC inherited the ROC’s claims after the Chinese civil war. Thus, the ROC’s interpretation of its claims is relevant to the PRC’s claims. A more limited reading of the claims would not be inconsistent with China’s official position as set out in its 2009 and 2011 statements to the United Nations.

Taiwan’s overtures, however, have largely been ignored. At the root of this is China’s “One-China” principle, which has cast a long shadow over Taiwan and made ASEAN and its member states fearful to engage Taipei. Though being more receptive toward Taiwan’s overtures in the South China Sea need not necessarily be inconsistent with China’s One-China principle, ASEAN and its member states are arguably unduly conservative in this regard given China’s huge economic and political clout. They have also traditionally been fearful of Taiwan and China cooperating to defend the islands from a third party attack or to bolster claims to the South China Sea, though Taipei has consistently rejected the possibility of cooperating with Beijing on claims in the South China Sea since worsening cross-Strait relations from the mid-1990s.

In order to carve out a modest political space for itself in the South China Sea, Taiwan should:

&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li><strong>Clarify that its claims accord with UNCLOS and international law without expressly eschewing the dashed line.</strong></li>
</ol>
Taipei can clarify what it means when it claims the four archipelagos in the South China Sea as well as their “surrounding waters” as the territory of the ROC, or consistently pronounce that its maritime claims are from the islands over which it claims sovereignty in accordance with UNCLOS and international law. An important consideration in this respect is that interpreting the dashed line as a claim to the wide expanse of water enclosed within it would win itself no favors with the United States, its single most important ally. The U.S. Department of State <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCUQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.state.gov%2Fdocuments%2Forganization%2F234936.pdf&amp;ei=OaFcVaqOLomeNq2TgZgN&amp;usg=AFQjCNFP2ZdQJeRaCqWX0Nz-V01m4tiSNQ&amp;bvm=bv.93756505,d.eXY">report</a> analyzing China’s maritime claims in the South China Sea, specifically its dashed line, is also an indirect pronouncement on Taiwan’s claims insofar as they assert that the dashed line represents a national boundary or a historic claim over the maritime space within it.

Apart from encouraging China to be more inclined to interpret the dashed line in a way that accords with international law and act accordingly, clarification of Taiwan’s claims is also likely to have a salutary domestic effect: incremental adjustments to Taiwan’s position in the South China Sea will make any subsequent changes the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) might introduce or threaten to introduce less dramatic and destabilizing. Some within the DPP have threatened that if the DPP comes to power in 2016, it will confine Taiwan’s territorial claims to islands under its control and (explicitly) abandon the dashed line.

Although Taiwan should clarify what it means by “surrounding waters” or make clear that its maritime claims are from the islands over which it claims sovereignty in accordance with UNCLOS and international law, it should not expressly abandon the dashed line (nor be expected to do so). While important, Taiwan’s interests in the South China Sea are second to maintaining stable relations with China and the ability to protect the island of Taiwan itself from any mainland attack. Expressly abandoning the dashed line is likely to undermine Taiwan’s primary interest in maintaining stable relations with China. It would anger China since it would explicitly undermine the legitimacy of any Chinese claim to the dashed line as national boundary or enclosing historic rights and put China in a bad light.

&nbsp;
<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>Continue promoting President Ma Ying-jeou’s plan for the East China Sea in the South China Sea.</strong></li>
</ol>
The broad principles of the East China Peace Initiative, namely, “safeguarding sovereignty, shelving disputes, pursuing peace and reciprocity, and promoting joint exploration and development,” can usefully be applied to the South China Sea. Promoting these tenets will help to demonstrate to the other players that Taiwan is willing and able to constructively engage in managing the dispute.

&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>Provide evidence that Taiping Island is an “island” capable of sustaining human habitation or economic life under Article 121 UNCLOS.</strong></li>
</ol>
It is not entirely clear whether the status of Taiping Island was addressed by the Philippines in its memorial and supplementary submission. If it was, Taiwan has a strong interest in providing evidence that it is in fact an “island” capable of sustaining human habitation or economic life and therefore entitled to an EEZ and continental shelf. The ROC is in the best position to provide appropriate evidence having occupied Taiping Island since 1956. Doing so would assist the tribunal in giving due regard to Taiwan’s rights and interests in the South China Sea. It would also indirectly support consistency between Taiwan’s claims and UNCLOS and international law.

&nbsp;
<ol start="4">
	<li><strong>Push behind the scenes for participation in Code of Conduct negotiations and in cooperative activities involving all claimants in ways that will be consistent with China’s One-China principle.</strong></li>
</ol>
All parties who have an interest in better management of the dispute and a more peaceful region—including China—have an interest in supporting Taiwan’s inclusion in negotiations and activities relating to the South China Sea. This can be done in ways consistent with China’s One-China principle. There is precedent for Taiwan participating in organizations and meetings where it cannot be a member because of the requirement of statehood. Taiwan can be invited to participate in Code of Conduct negotiations as an observer or guest. Taiwan could also be invited to declare that it will abide by the terms of the Code of Conduct without it being a party to it. Cooperative activities between claimants, such as marine environmental protection; marine scientific research; safety of navigation and communication at sea; search and rescue operations; and combating transnational crime, can be negotiated and agreed to between the agencies directly involved, rather than formal treaties.

ASEAN and its member states would do well to re-evaluate their position toward Taiwan and be more open to its involvement. Taiwan’s involvement recognizes facts on the ground, namely, its control of the largest natural island, the regular patrol of the seas by its coast guard, and its huge fishing industry—one of the largest in the Pacific. Including Taiwan is a pragmatic and necessary part of managing conflict.

Crucially, Taiwan and what it claims (and by implication does not claim) can help stabilize the South China Sea dispute. China, with high levels of nationalism within its country—and because it can get away with it—will not denounce the dashed line. However, it will want, as far as possible, to avoid being perceived as riding roughshod over international law and might be motivated to interpret the dashed line in a way that is consistent with international law and act accordingly. It still cares what the international community thinks and it is important for ASEAN countries to work this leverage.

The United States wants to see this dispute managed peacefully and in accordance with international law. Thus, it too has an interest in supporting Taiwan’s participation in regional negotiations and in cooperative activities. The United States, however, is hampered in its ability to directly appeal to China to encourage this, given Beijing’s tendency to regard the United States as meddling and its proposals with suspicion. U.S. involvement in this regard may thus be counterproductive; it needs to be broached quietly and sensitively, if at all.

On the other hand, the United States can and should do all it can to support Taiwan clarifying its claims so that it more clearly accords with UNCLOS and international law. Privately, the United States should reassure Taiwan that it does not expect it to explicitly abandon the dashed line, despite some calls from within the United States for Taipei to do so. The United States should also work behind the scenes to encourage ASEAN and its member states to welcome Taiwan’s participation, making a strong case for why Taipei’s involvement will have a salutary effect on reducing tensions in the South China Sea.

China, too, has strong reasons to regard Taiwan’s inclusion as a positive thing. In light of Taiwan’s upcoming and potentially raucous 2016 elections, it is particularly important for China to put cross-Strait relations on firmer foundations. Supporting Taiwan’s participation in cooperative activities will also be in keeping with the Chinese foreign ministry’s dual-track approach to the dispute, which is to seek one-on-one negotiations on sovereignty issues, and multilateral arrangements within the region to promote peace and stability in the South China Sea. The promotion of peace and stability in the South China Sea must, as a matter of efficacy, include <em>all </em>important actors regardless of their legal status. Bringing Taiwan into the fold will help demonstrate China’s sincerity in seeking a peaceful solution to the dispute.

<em>Highlights from Shangri-la Dialogue 2014. Video credit: IISS.</em>

The 2015 Shangri-La Dialogue kicks off on Friday, May 29, in Singapore and runs through the weekend.   The defense summit will feature a keynote speech by Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsein Loong and plenary remarks by U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, Japanese Minister of Defense Gen Nakatani, Indian Defense Minister Rao Singh, and many more. Senator John McCain and Admiral Harry Harris, the newly-anointed commander of Pacific Command, will address the forum in special sessions on Saturday, May 30.  China has selected as its Shangri-La representative Admiral Sun Jianguo, the deputy Chief of the PLA General Staff Department. The full Shangri-La agenda is <a href="http://www.iiss.org/-/media/Documents/Events/Shangri-La%20Dialogue/SLD15/SLD%202015%20Speaker%20Agenda.pdf">available here</a>.

This year’s dialogue comes with tensions running high in the South China Sea, and China’s island building is likely to be a prominent topic. Shangri-La has often been a forum in which regional leaders air their concerns on major defense issues: The 2014 dialogue took place while China’s HD-981 oil rig was deployed in the waters around the Paracel Islands. In their Shangri-La remarks, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel called out China’s “destabilizing, unilateral activities in the South China Sea,” and Chinese Lt. General Wang Guanzhong dismissed their criticism as “full of words of threat an intimidation.” For the maritime security highlights from Abe, Hagel, and Wang’s speeches watch the video above. Read on for some of the other greatest hits from Shangri-La 2014, and stay tuned as we track major maritime security developments at this year’s forum!
<blockquote><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #0c8d79;"><strong>"Crisis and conflicts are unpredictable. But we can reduce that uncertainty by proactively building among us strong relations and multilateral frameworks that build trust and confidence through cooperation and consensus. A stronger and more stable Asia will benefit all our citizens and the world." </strong></span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #0c8d79;">-Dr. Ng Eng Hen, Minister for Defence, Singapore</span></blockquote>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">"But in recent months, China has undertaken destabilizing, unilateral actions asserting its claims in the South China Sea. It has restricted access to Scarborough Reef, put pressure on the long-standing Philippine presence at the Second Thomas Shoal, begun land reclamation activities at multiple locations, and moved an oil rig into disputed waters near the Paracel Islands. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The United States has been clear and consistent. We take no position on competing territorial claims. But we firmly oppose any nation’s use of intimidation, coercion, or the threat of force to assert those claims. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We also oppose any effort – by any nation – to restrict overflight or freedom of navigation – whether from military or civilian vessels, from countries big or small. The United States will not look the other way when fundamental principles of the international order are being challenged."</span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">-Chuck Hagel, Secretary of Defense, United States</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-size: 14pt;">"Now, when we say ‘the rule of law at sea’ – what exactly do we mean in concrete terms? If we take the fundamental spirit that we have infused into international law over the ages and reformulate it into three principles, we find the rule of law at sea is actually a matter of common sense. The first principle is that states shall make their claims based on international law. The second is that states shall not use force or coercion in trying to drive their claims. The third principle is that states shall seek to settle disputes by peaceful means. So to reiterate this, it means making claims that are faithful in light of international law, not resorting to force or coercion, and resolving all disputes through peaceful means."</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">-Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan</span></blockquote>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">"China has settled land border demarcation with 12 out of 14 of its neighbors and completed the delimitation of Beibu Gulf with Vietnam. The PLA has set up 64 border meeting stations. Over 2,000 meetings were held between Chinese and neighboring border troops in these stations in 2013. We are actively engaged in maintaining maritime security and stability in the neighboring area. 16 joint patrols of Beibu Gulf have been carried out by China and Vietnam. In 2002, China and ASEAN countries signed the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and jointly set forth the principle that all disputes over territory and jurisdiction should be resolved peacefully through friendly consultation and negotiations between sovereign states directly involved in the disputes. The PLA actively supports the implementation of the DOC and pushes forward the consultation on the Code of Conduct on the South China Sea, with a view to maintaining security and stability in the South China Sea. While firmly safeguarding its sovereignty and legitimate interests, China has demonstrated utmost sincerity and patience in its commitment to settling disputes peacefully through consultations and negotiations with parties involved. China has never threatened to use force, and has never taken provocative actions. We will never accept provocation by others under the pretext of “Proactive Contribution to Peace” that stirs up tension for their selfish interests." </span>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">-Lieutenant General Wang Guanzhong, Deputy Chief, General Staff Department, People's Liberation Army, China</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #0c8d79;"><strong>"Australia does not take a position on competing claims in the South China Sea but we have a legitimate interest in the maintenance of peace and stability, respect for international law, unimpeded trade, and freedom of navigation. The use of force or coercion to unilaterally alter the status quo in the East China Sea and the South China Sea is simply not acceptable. We urge all parties to exercise restraint, restrain from actions that could increase tensions, to clarify and pursue claims in accordance with international law including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea." </strong></span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #0c8d79;">-Senator David Johnson, Minister for Defence, Australia</span></blockquote>

		<title>China&#039;s Admiral Sun Jianguo at Shangri-La</title>
		<link>http://amti.csis.org/cogitasia-leaderboard-sun-jianguo/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[China has opted not to send its Defense Minister to the 2015 Shangri-La Dialogue, as in past years. Instead, Beijing's representative will be Admiral Sun Jianguo. Who is he and what should we expect from his attendance? Read on to find out!

<strong>Who is he?</strong>

Admiral Sun Jianguo of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy has served as Deputy Chief of Staff for the PLA General Staff Department since 2009, a position with status equal to a Chinese military region commander.

Born in 1952 in Hebei province, he joined the PLA in 1968 in the midst of the Cultural Revolution. At that time, the military was de-professionalized and extremely ideological in focus. He previously served as captain of both conventional and nuclear submarines.

His assumption of a leadership role reflects the trending ascendance of powerful figures’ former <em>mishu </em>(secretaries, personal assistants, or chiefs of staff). Sun is the former <em>mishu</em> of General Chen Bingde, former chief of the General Staff. Some had predicted in 2012 that Sun <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2010/06/~/media/Research/Files/Opinions/2010/6/29%20military%20leadership%20li/0628_military_leadership_li.PDF">would take over command of the PLA Navy</a>, but Admiral Wu Shengli has so far remained as commander.

<a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/15526003729_968500ed02_c_800.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3402" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/15526003729_968500ed02_c_800.jpg" alt="15526003729_968500ed02_c_800" width="800" height="534" /></a>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>Admiral Sun Jianguo, Deputy Chief of the General Staff, People’s Liberation Army, with Gen. Vincent K. Brooks, commander, U.S. Army Pacific, on Nov 4, 2014 during a visit at Fort Shafter, Hawaii. Source: ARPAC PAO’s flickr photostream, U.S. Government Work.</em></span>

<strong>Why is he in the news?</strong>

Sun will be China’s 2015 representative to the <a href="https://www.iiss.org/en/events/shangri-s-la-s-dialogue">Shangri-La Dialogue</a>, where Wang Guanzhong made headlines in 2014 for “<a href="http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2014/06/01/Shangri-La-Dialogue-General-Wang-Guanzhong-returns-fire-at-Abe-and-Hagel.aspx?COLLCC=951497281&amp;COLLCC=3573844705&amp;COLLCC=3354017861&amp;">launching a rhetorical fusillade</a>” at Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe and former U.S. secretary of defense Chuck Hagel, both of whom had spoken in harsh tones about China’s increasingly assertive posture in the South China Sea.

Sun echoed Wang’s fiery language against Japan and the United States last June at the <a href="http://www.sino-us.com/395/16174383522.html">Third World Peace Forum</a>. He has also asserted that <a href="http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20150303000022&amp;cid=1101">military tensions with the United States have been good for China’s military development</a> and served to establish an equal footing between the two nations.

<strong>What can we expect from him?</strong>

Sun leads a large Chinese delegation to this year’s Shangri-La Dialogue, which reflects China’s increasing desire to take on additional responsibility for regional security. However, China is the only major nation that is not sending its defense minister, and has only done so once, in 2011. Speakers like U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter are <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/china-s-territorial-claims-expected-to-be-hot-topic-at-shangri-la-dialogue-1.348839">expected to focus again on China’s behavior in the South China Sea</a>, where China will likely come under fire for its artificial <a href="http://warontherocks.com/2015/05/shangri-la-wont-be-a-fairyland-for-beijing/">island-building</a> and generally assertive posture.

Sun has expressed support for bilateral ties in U.S.-China relations, calling them “an important part of the new pattern of the relationship between great powers.” A Chinese defense ministry spokesman has said <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/923611.shtml">his speech will focus on collaboration, dialogue, and joint defense in the region</a>. Despite this, there are several indications of underlying tensions, including recent military reports released from both China and the United States.

China’s newly released white paper, “China’s Military Strategy” is <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-shifts-maritime-military-focus-to-open-seas-1432648980">expected to animate</a> discussion at the Shangri-La Dialogue. The document is a preview of China’s key talking points and future strategy, <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/05/in-new-white-paper-chinas-military-embraces-global-mission/">emphasizing a shift</a> toward maritime threats and an expansion of focus from offshore defense to defense of international waters. Sun’s remarks will be delivered against the backdrop of this new strategy white paper, which pushes the idea that a stronger PLA will contribute to stability in the Asia Pacific.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As delegates assemble for the 14<sup>th</sup> annual Asia Security Summit, better known as the Shangri-La Dialogue, regional tensions are running high over China’s island building in the South China Sea.  As the weekend summit gets under way, here are the issues to watch.

<strong>Stormy Seas and Skies: </strong>In the last several months, the region and the world have grown increasingly concerned about China’s buildup in the Spratly Islands.  The following developments have occurred in the month of May:
<ul>
	<li>We now know that China has created artificial islands at seven different locations in the Spratlys, reclaimed at least 2,000 acres of new land, and is now militarizing these outposts. It has nearly finished building an airstrip on one island. The latest photos of the China’s new islands can be <a href="http://amti.csis.org/island-tracker/">found here</a>.</li>
	<li>Top U.S. policymakers, including <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/04/09/remarks-president-obama-town-hall-young-leaders-americas">President Barack Obama</a>, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/16/us-usa-kerry-china-southchinasea-idUSKBN0O104Q20150516">Secretary of State John Kerry</a>, and <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=128922">Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter</a> have spoken out against China’s militarization of the islands and called for the peaceful resolution of disputes. <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/t1267839.shtml">Chinese officials continue</a> to maintain that the islands are Chinese sovereign territory, that they have civilian as well as military purposes, and that the United States should not intervene in their affairs.</li>
	<li>The Pentagon has <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-military-proposes-challenge-to-china-sea-claims-1431463920">reportedly considered</a> sending planes and vessels within 12 nautical miles of China’s land features to demonstrate that the United States did not recognize these as rocks or islands under international law.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-19/u-s-says-navy-ship-met-chinese-vessel-on-south-china-sea-patrol">The USS Fort Worth</a> littoral combat ship was tailed by a Chinese frigate while conducting patrols near the Spratly Islands.</li>
	<li>Last week, the Pentagon released video of a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/26/politics/south-china-sea-navy-surveillance-plane-jim-sciutto/">P-8 aerial patrol</a> over some of China’s artificial features. In the video, Chinese military personnel repeatedly warned off the U.S. aircraft, but the U.S. pilot maintained that he was in international airspace, conducting lawful activities.</li>
	<li>This morning, reports are out that China <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-surveillance-on-island-reveals-chinese-arms-1432864632">has placed new mobile artillery</a> on one of its artificial Spratly features.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Island Ire:  </strong>These recent developments raise several pressing concerns and questions, many of which are likely to be addressed by leaders at Shangri-La. These include:
<ul>
	<li>What does China intend to do with its Spratly outposts? To what extent will they be militarized? Can other countries dissuade China from a serious military buildup?</li>
	<li>What does China believe its rights are under international law when it comes to the seas and skies around these islands?</li>
	<li>Will China’s presence on the islands threaten freedom of navigation and freedom of overflight in the South China Sea?</li>
	<li>How will China’s island buildup affect an ongoing international legal case that has been brought by the Philippines against China over its South China Sea claims?</li>
	<li>Will ASEAN countries demonstrate unified concern on these issues?</li>
	<li>Given the importance of their relationships with China, how will the United States and countries in the region demonstrate a concerted response?</li>
</ul>
<strong>Who to Watch: </strong>These issues are likely to take center stage several times as Shangri-La unfolds. Keep an eye out for strong South China Sea statements from the following speakers on Saturday, May 30 and Sunday, May 31 (all times are in Singapore):
<ul>
	<li>Saturday, 9:00 am- U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter</li>
	<li>Saturday, 3:00 pm- PACOM Commander Harry Harris</li>
	<li>Sunday, 9:00 am- Chinese Chief of the General Staff Admiral Sun Jianguo</li>
</ul>

		<title>China’s Missed Opportunity at the Shangri-La Dialogue</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since China first sent a senior military officer to participate in the Shangri-la Dialogue (SLD) in 2007, it has come to the annual security meeting prepared with a carefully crafted strategy to deflect criticism and advance Chinese interests. This year was no exception. On the eve of the SLD, Beijing released its Defense White Paper, which for the first time sketched out China’s military strategy as a demonstration of Chinese transparency. Recognizing that there would be substantial attention paid to China’s large-scale land reclamation activity in the South China Sea, Beijing selected an admiral, Deputy Chief of the PLA General Staff Sun Jianguo, to head this year’s delegation.

Admiral Sun’s speech to the large gathering of defense officials and security analysts from around the world was devoted to providing reassurance of China’s peaceful intentions, emphasizing Chinese willingness to provide public security goods, and insisting that China’s actions in the South China Sea are “legitimate, reasonable, and justified.” There were also some jabs at the United States. Sun declared that China would never “subjugate itself to hegemony by external forces,” He denied that China is challenging freedom of navigation, and insisted that the Chinese military will “unswerving defend” the nation’s “core interests.”

In contrast to last year, China’s military representative stuck to his script. Provoked by Secretary of Defense Hagel’s harsh remarks in his SLD speech in 2014, General Wang Guangzhong had revised his text to rebut the criticism that China had undertaken destabilizing, unilateral actions asserting its claims in the South China Sea by putting pressure on the long-standing Philippine presence at Second Thomas Shoal, by beginning land reclamation activities at multiple locations, and by positioning the massive HD-981 oil rig into disputed waters near the Paracel Islands. This year, the Chinese delegation feared they would face similar muscular charges. In the run up to the SLD, Assistant Secretary of Defense David Shear and Assistant Secretary of State Danny Russel had made harsh statements about China’s activities in the South China Sea in congressional testimony; a flight by a U.S. P-8A surveillance plane with a CNN reporter on board had released photos of China’s artificial islands and a voice recording of a Chinese military officer warning the U.S. aircraft to stay out of China’s “military alert zone;” and Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter had forcefully rebuked China in a speech in Hawaii, asserting that China was “out of step with international norms.”

But China’s fears that U.S. criticism would reach a crescendo at the SLD were not borne out, and the Chinese delegates were visibly relieved. Rather than singling out China for bad behavior, Carter acknowledged that other South China Sea claimants had also built military outposts, although he stressed that the pace and scope of China’s land reclamation activity far outstripped the others. Carter also pledged to continue to improve US-China military-to-military ties and noted the importance of building habits of cooperation. He emphasized that the Asia-Pacific region requires a security architecture in which “everybody rises and everybody wins.” Sandwiched in the middle of the speech were pointed messages that the U.S. would not be deterred from sailing and flying in international airspace and waters, and a reiteration that China is out of step with prevailing rules and norms. Carter also called for an immediate and lasting halt to land reclamation and an agreement among claimants to not further militarize the disputed features.

Chinese PLA officers and civilian scholars whom I canvassed following the speech all described Carter’s remarks as “balanced” and “moderate.” Even the publicized flight by the U.S. defense secretary the day before over the Malacca Strait in a V-22 Osprey, which Carter mentioned in his speech, did not ruffle feathers. A retired Chinese PLA General said that the flight could be interpreted as showing concern for maintaining open sea lines of communication, which, he said, is a concern that China shares.

While it is true that the tone of Carter’s speech was somewhat less harsh than Hagel’s the year before, in my view, the difference was not as stark as the Chinese maintained. This year, however, China came determined to avoid a confrontation and possible setback in U.S.-China relations. With a visit to DC by Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission Fan Changlong less than two weeks away followed by the US-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue and a summit between Presidents Obama and Xi Jinping planned for September, the Chinese wanted to keep the relationship on an even keel. “Both sides realized they should not make unnecessary moves to undermine the overall positive trend of bilateral relations” and instead should “create a positive atmosphere for continuing cooperation,” asserted one Chinese participant. Left unstated was that China had likely concluded that General Wang’s dramatic performance and confrontational response to the U.S. last year had not worked to China’s advantage.

Despite evident significant preparation and a more positive approach, China’s strategy this year nevertheless did not succeed in its objectives, largely due to Admiral Sun Jianguo’s refusal to directly answer any of the more than a dozen questions posed to him following his speech. In anticipation of the barrage of questions, the MND staff prepared a briefing book for Sun with multiple tabs so he could easily access and recite Chinese policy on any issue. Asked about North Korea’s recent SLBM launch, Sun could be seen on the large screen flipping to the Korea tab of his book. He then faithfully read a few sentences about China’s commitment to peace and denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. He did the same in response to a question on cyber security. Sun read a lengthy statement on the South China Sea which reiterated Chinese intentions to primarily use its outposts for peaceful purposes that will benefit the entire region and asserted that China would consider establishing an air defense identification zone in the South China Sea only if its security is threatened. Most questions were simply ignored, including a rhetorical, but impish query from Bloomberg report Josh Rogin, who asked with whom China is cooperating and who other than China is winning in the South China Sea. The only extemporaneous comment made by Sun was a closing ambiguous sentence that urged observers to base their judgments about China on its actions.

Members of the Chinese PLA delegation privately explained that they had urged Sun to attempt to answer questions directly and spontaneously, but he “wasn’t comfortable doing that.” They explained that the admiral had very limited experience at such international conferences and held out hope that if he attends the SLD again next year he might be more relaxed.

Sun’s stilted performance was a missed opportunity for China to address the concerns about Chinese intentions and behavior that were raised throughout the two-day meeting by defense representatives and scholars from around the world, but most importantly from China’s neighboring countries. Even worse, his unwillingness to respond to any of the questions posed left the impression that China could care less about others’ concerns and will stay the course in the South China Sea regardless.

Undoubtedly, members of the Chinese delegation took copious notes during the SLD and, hopefully, they will convey a faithful summary that will be passed up to Xi Jinping. The chorus of calls for a rules-based order and rejection of a might-makes-right approach should be taken seriously by Xi. Failure to do so may well result in what Secretary Carter described as the “continued coalescing of concerned nations around the world” to resist what is increasingly viewed as a growing Chinese threat to regional peace and stability.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Carter Defends the South China Sea at Shangri-La</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Saturday morning at the Shangri-La defense dialogue in Singapore, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter delivered a long-anticipated speech on security issues in Asia.  As tensions have mounted over China’s island building in the South China Sea, Carter has been one of the administration’s strongest voices, <a href="http://www.pacom.mil/Media/News/tabid/5693/Article/589963/us-pacific-command-change-of-command.aspx">calling the </a>militarization of the islands a challenge to international norms and reaffirming the United States’ intention to uphold freedom of navigation and overflight, and to defend international law.  Carter’s Shangri-La speech did not disappoint; he broadened the aperture focusing on wider strategic goals for the region, he called for a regional architecture that gives all countries and people in the Asia-Pacific the right to rise, and spoke at length on the South China Sea disputes. Here are some of the prominent themes from the Secretary’s remarks.

<strong>Asia is on the ascent, and that is good for the United States.  </strong>Carter pointed out that America understands and embraces the economic and geopolitical calculus that points to Asia being the most dynamic region in the world – and reminded all that the United States is Pacific nation.  He hailed Asia as the fulcrum of the global economy, but reminded his audience that the U.S. economy was back in full force. He reaffirmed Washington’s and his personal commitment to the rebalance, noting new military platforms that the U.S. would deploy in the region, such as P-8 patrol aircraft and Sumgait stealth destroyers and reiterating the administration’s intent to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).   Carter also repeated the United States’ intent to uphold rules and norms in the region, strengthen institutions, and modernize alliances and partnerships. Carter’s message to Asia was that he understands economics is the foundation for security in the region.

<strong>A strong stand on land reclamation in the South China Sea. </strong> Carter was firm and nuanced when he spoke about China’s island building in the Spratlys. He acknowledged that other claimants had also built up outposts in the area but stated that China had gone “farther and faster” with little indication of its underlying intentions. He called for a halt to land reclamation on all sides, for peaceful resolution of disputes, and said that the United States would continue to support claimants’ pursuit of international legal arbitration. Carter also put China on notice that the United States would continue to fly and sail wherever international law allows, noting that the construction of an artificial island with an airstrip did not confer sovereign rights or permit restrictions on air and maritime transit.  He rebuked China’s building as inimical to international rules and norms, and noted that it was catalyzing new balancing partnerships in the region as other states sought to respond.  All Asian countries noted his reiteration of the U.S. commitment to the Philippines during the swearing in of Admiral Harry Harris at PACOM on his way to Singapore.

In the question and answer portion of the address, Carter handled steadily three frank questions on China’s land reclamation and Washington’s responses. The Secretary refused to speculate on China’s long-term intentions for its outposts. He stated that China and not the United States was creating new facts in the South China Sea and noted that many countries in the region shared U.S. concern about China’s behavior.

Carter also took a question from Chinese PLA Colonel Zhou, who argued that China’s Spratly activities were legitimate and justified. Carter responded that the United States was calling for a halt to land reclamation from <em>all</em> sides, and stated that U.S. patrols of the seas and skies of the region were longstanding and would continue.

<strong>Charting the way forward.  </strong>Carter noted that the United States was preparing to sign a new Joint Vision Statement with Vietnam and a Defense Framework with India, but his most significant policy reveal was the official debut of a new Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative.  If implemented, the Pentagon-sponsored fund could give up to $425 million dollars for partner capacity building efforts in the region over the next several years, but it may meet with resistance due to Sequestration.

On the diplomatic front, Carter reiterated the perennial call for China and ASEAN to sign a binding Code of Conduct. The speech did not provide a complete roadmap for U.S. strategy in the South China Sea, but this should not come as a surprise—Carter rightly aimed his message at longer term more strategic ideas.  The United States’ contribution to Asia’s peace and prosperity, and therefore its investment in its own security and economic future, is based on broader goals. Carter’s comments underscored the need for regional unity and implicitly acknowledged hesitance among some other states when it comes to signaling to China that all want it to be successful and secure, but not at the expense of its neighbors’ sovereignty.

The United States knows that it needs buy-in from regional partners if new proposals are to be viable, so a public speech at a high-level defense forum were not the right place to test the waters with a new grand plan. Carter acknowledged the importance of the U.S.-China relationship on issues such as North Korea, and reassurance towards Beijing remains an important part of any U.S. strategy.

<strong>The bottom line. </strong>Carter has clearly emerged as the Obama administration’s point-man on Asia. He and the new Pacific Commander, Harry Harris, appear to be pushing for a more robust U.S. response to Beijing’s “cabbage peeling” strategy of coercion in the South China Sea. An important part of that strategy will be demonstrating to Beijing that the United States is willing to tolerate a higher degree of risk in order to dissuade China from further destabilizing moves such as militarizing the newly reclaimed land facilities or declaring an Air Defense Identification Zone over the area.  It is not clear whether the White House has the same appetite for risk or whether Beijing will now be dissuaded from its current accelerated path.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“China’s Military Strategy,” released on May 26, 2015, is the 9<sup>th</sup> Chinese defense white paper since 1998. For the first time, the white paper elaborates comprehensively on the missions and strategic tasks of China’s armed forces in the new political environment and emphasizes the essence of the strategic concept of <em>active defense</em>. There are four critical security domains highlighted in this White Paper: challenges for outer space security; security of strategic SLOCs and overseas interests; maintenance of a minimum nuclear capacity sufficient to meet national security demand; an increased capacity for cyber security.

Four important messages could be read between lines. First, China is aware of the profound changes in the international situation. While a world war is unlikely, China admits that the world still faces both immediate and potential threat of local war. China’s threat perception includes “hegemonism, power politics and neo-interventionism.” “Border and territorial disputes” are highlighted in the list of hotspot issues. Though not pointing a finger directly at the United States, the white paper shows China’s deep concern about increasing U.S. engagement in the South China Sea, which can be read from its assessment of the national security situation.

The United States is described as carrying on “its ‘rebalancing’ strategy and enhanc[ing] its military presence and its military alliances in this region,” in parallel with “Japan’s effort of dodging the post-war mechanism” and “some offshore neighbors taking provocative actions and reinforce[ing] their military presence on China’s reefs and islands that they illegally occupied.” The example of “constant close-in-air and sea surveillance and reconnaissance against China” is explicitly highlighted in the white paper. China has consistently opposed these activities based on its interpretation of 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the “legitimacy of military activities in foreign countries’ EEZ,” and this is a long standing argument with the United States. The U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon surveillance aircraft <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/21/us-southchinasea-usa-china-idUSKBN0O60AY20150521">directly flying over</a> a Chinese administered artificial island constructed atop the Fiery Cross Reef in the South China Sea is simply not constructive to the management of the South China Sea dispute, and not helpful for a healthy China-U.S. relations in the maritime domain. Despite the question of the legitimacy under UNCLOS, which is worth debating, activities of this kind have the potential to trigger accidents at sea, like EP-3 incident in 2001. Such incidents are clearly not the interests of China and the United States. A regional mechanism to help avoid accidents is urgently needed. Such a mechanism could be in line with the existing international instruments, such as Incidents at Sea Agreement (INCSEA) or a Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES).

Second, “active defense” is the essence of the military strategic thought indicated in the white paper, which boils down to: adherence to the unity of strategic defense and operational and tactical offences; adherence to the principles of defense, self-defense and post-emptive strike”; the basic point of “preparation for military struggle (PMS)” will be placed on “winning informationized local wars, highlighting maritime military struggle and maritime PMS.” The wording of “maritime military struggle and PMS” may catch eyes when it is read in the context of maritime disputes in the East China Sea and the South China Sea. However, another important message could also be revealed from “adherence to the stance that ‘we will not attack unless we are attacked, but we will surely counterattack if attacked’.” No one in this region wants to see a breakout of a military conflict near home, even it is small scale, given the interdependence of ASEAN and China. China assures in this White Paper that it will not be the one who “fires the first gun.” China’s concern derives from the potential intervention from the extra-regional states, which may take provocative attempts due to the misperception of each other and miscalculation or assessment of the situation in this region. China hopes to work with ASEAN to solve their differences in the South China Sea in their preferred ways.

Third, the navy will shift its focus to "open seas protection," rather than "offshore waters defense" alone. In general, the PLA is seeking to shift away from a narrow focus on defense of its territory and near-periphery, toward the ability to defend and secure Chinese national interests farther abroad. For the PLA Navy, that will mean moving from an emphasis on “offshore waters defense” to an equal focus on “offshore waters defense” and “open seas protection.” On the one hand, the PLA Navy is expected to play a bigger role in pursing its maritime interests. On the other hand, China wants to play more of a role in protecting the security of strategic SLOSs and oversea interests, and to participate in international maritime cooperation so as to provide strategic support for building itself into a maritime power.

Fourth, in the field of “preparation for military struggle,” China emphasizes preparing for military operations other than war such as emergency rescue and disaster relief, counter-terrorism and stability maintenance, rights and interests protection, guard duty, international peacekeeping, and international humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. For military and security cooperation, China will endeavor to establish fair and effective collective security mechanisms and military confidence-building measures. This statement is clearly a positive message from this white paper.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Showdown at Shangri-La: Confronting China’s Maritime Ambitions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[China is far from a monolithic power. Its rapid ascent has transformed it into both a centripetal force of integration as well as a centrifugal force of fragmentation. Earlier this year, China managed to pull off a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/03/asia-infrastructure-investment-bank-china-150326071738756.html">major strategic coup</a> against the United States (U.S.) by astutely convincing almost all relevant economies in Asia and the West to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), despite Washington’s vehement opposition.

The Obama administration was left bitter and isolated, as China flagrantly chipped away at the United States’ historical position as the underwriter of the global financial order. Most countries, pragmatically recognizing the necessity for Chinese capital, cautiously welcomed the AIIB initiative as a much-needed -- albeit insufficient -- remedy to the glaring infrastructure spending gap in the region. At the same time, China has also become a polarizing force, progressively contributing to deterioration in longstanding maritime disputes in the Western Pacific.

This year’s Shangri-La Dialogue certainly lived up to expectations, as Washington and its allies squared off with (an isolated) China over the latter’s massive construction activities and growing military presence in the South China Sea. Meanwhile, non-claimant states such as Singapore, the security conference’ host, showed little hesitance to express their deepening worries over the trajectory of the ongoing maritime disputes. With few signs of compromise on the horizon and as Chinese military officials <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/01/world/asia/china-says-it-could-set-up-air-defense-zone-in-south-china-sea.html?_r=0">openly dangle</a> the option of imposing an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the South China Sea, Washington and its allies are scrambling for an appropriate response against further Chinese provocation.

<strong>Clash of Titans </strong>

The Dialogue was certainly an international diplomatic debut for the U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, whose highly-anticipated speech came on the heels of a weeks-long campaign by Pentagon to challenge Chinese construction activities. By <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/face-chinas-navy-stalks-us-ship-south-china-sea-12882">deploying</a> surveillance aircraft (along with media personnel) and warships close to China’s artificially constructed features in the Spratly chain of islands, the U.S. Navy has been openly contesting Beijing’s sovereignty claims to these features. It is also a direct rebuke to China’s militarization of the disputes, with reports suggesting Beijing <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/28/politics/china-ashton-carter-south-china-sea-islands/">has deployed motorized artillery pieces</a> and other defensive systems to the area.

Carter reiterated Washington’s concern about any Chinese-imposed “restrictions on international air or maritime transit” and emphasized how his country “will fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows, as US forces do all over the world.” He rejected any Chinese sovereignty claim over artificially-altered <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part8.htm">low-tide elevations</a>, which are not subject to appropriation and can’t generate their won territorial waters under international law. Carter did not rule out the possibility of deploying American military assets into the 12 nautical miles of Chinese-claimed features.

Clearly, the Pentagon’s chief concerns are freedom of navigation, both for merchant fleets and American naval forces, as well as the prevention of the imposition of a Chinese ADIZ in the area, which could <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/chinas-mad-dash-the-south-china-sea-12866">imperil the position of treaty allies</a> such as the Philippines, who occupy advanced features and facilities in the area. Predictably, the Chinese defense delegation countered by trying to present Beijing’s activities in the area as “justified, legitimate and reasonable." Senior Colonel Zhao Xiaozhuo of China's Academy of Military Science <a href="http://manilastandardtoday.com/mobile/2015/05/31/ash-carter-talks-tough-on-china-but-it-s-just-talk/">dismissed any suggestion</a> that Beijing is undermining freedom of navigation in the area, implausibly claiming the region has remained stable and peaceful because of China's great restraint.  China’s top delegate, Admiral Sun Jianguo tried to <a href="http://www.voanews.com/media/video/chinese-admiral-calls-island-building-justified/2802568.html">put a spin</a> on China’s construction activities by claiming Beijing was offering “international public services” through its sprawling facilities in the area, while Cui Tiankai, China’s Ambassador to Washington, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/video/chinese-ambassador-says-us-is-behind-escalating-dispute/6477E454-068B-4774-939A-C4649FA76D5C.html">blamed</a> the United States for escalating South China Sea tensions.

In short, China denied that there was any problem. China is not only out of step with international norms, as Carter pointed out, but also with much of the neighborhood. Not a single country, not even China’s loyal allies, tried to openly justify or defend China’s actions in the South China Sea.

<strong>Common Concern </strong>

Singapore has traditionally guarded its prosperity and security by adopting an astute equi-balancing strategy towards Beijing and Washington. As a trade-dependent economy, surrounded by bigger nations and historical rivals such as Malaysia, Singapore has relied on a largely symbiotic Sino-American relationship to secure a conducive environment for sustained growth and prosperity in the region.

In recent years, however, Singapore has been alarmed by China’s maritime assertiveness. In response, it has granted greater rotational access to American warships, <a href="http://news.usni.org/2015/04/24/two-littoral-combat-ships-to-deploy-to-singapore-next-year-four-by-2017">allowing for</a> permanent stationing of American Littoral Combat Ships (LCS), and has called for greater American strategic commitment to the region. In <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/keynote-speech-prime-minister-lee-hsien-loong-shangri-la-dialogue?singlepage=true">his keynote address</a>, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned about the “vicious cycle” in the South China Sea and emphasized how the disputes should be urgently “managed and contained”.

With Singapore soon taking over as the ASEAN-China country coordinator, he pushed for both sides to conclude a Code of Conduct (COC) “as soon as possible,” and called on “all parties adhere to international law, including the UN Convention on Law of the Sea.” Citing “historical rights”, China has opposed the application of UNCLOS to the disputes and has repeatedly dragged its feet on negotiating a COC.

Cognizant of the growing anxieties of many Southeast Asian nations, Carter unveiled a $425 million defense initiative aimed at enhancing the naval and coast guard capabilities of allies and strategic partners in the Association of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN). Key regional allies such as Australia have also reiterated their determination to continue patrols in the South China Sea, while Japan, thanks to the revised U.S.-Japan bilateral defense guideline, can more credibly consider the option of conducting joint aerial patrols in the South China Sea.

China’s <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-strategy-outline-confirms-trends-on-the-ground-u-s-says-1432702855">latest white paper</a>, however, mentions "offshore waters defense and open seas protection," and clearly reflects the fact that Beijing is determined to pursue its territorial ambitions and strategic interests in the high seas, especially in adjacent waters. The ultimate challenge, therefore, is to mobilize enough regional support and deploy necessary military assets against further Chinese adventurism -- but without triggering an open conflict. This will be an uphill battle, for sure.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>In Defense of Facts in the South China Sea</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Secretary of Defense Ash Carter’s address at this weekend’s Shangri-La Dialogue was generally well received by conference attendees and Asia-security watchers. A few critics have argued that Carter was “<a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-05-30/ash-carter-talks-tough-on-china-but-it-s-just-talk">just talk</a>.” What none have noted, however, is the fact that the Secretary’s remarks were the latest installation in a series of moves by the administration to articulate a fact-based approach to the South China Sea. This approach is a nuanced one and does not necessarily constitute a “strategy” for countering China’s recent moves. It is, however, a wise way to engage two key audiences to whom Carter was speaking at Shangri-La: other states in the region and China itself. Let me explain.

Until several weeks ago, the general public knew almost nothing about China’s island building efforts in the South China Sea. Major media outlets like the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/world/asia/new-images-show-china-literally-gaining-ground-in-south-china-sea.html?_r=0"><em>New York Times</em></a> and the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/us-navy-alarmed-at-beijings-great-wall-of-sand-in-south-china-sea/2015/04/01/dda11d76-70d7-4b69-bd87-292bd18f5918_story.html"><em>Washington Post</em></a> began to cover Beijing’s island building in April, when China had already been dredging for over a year. This is not entirely surprising: Spratly land reclamation is an esoteric topic even for the well-informed foreign policy observer. Moreover, the United States itself does not have claims in the South China Sea. Washington absolutely has core articulated interests, such as the security of its allies, the peaceful resolution of disputes, and freedom of navigation, but it is not easy to explain to the international community or to the American people <em>how </em>exactly these are jeopardized by piles of sand and dozens of dredgers. Maps and imagery can help to make these activities more tangible, but they still have to be connected to policy goals.

Enter the facts. In early May, U.S. officials stated that they believed that China had reclaimed 2,000 acres of new land in the Spratly Islands over the course of 18 months. This was the first official estimate of the scale of Beijing’s projects. They also acknowledged for the first time that other claimants had engaged in recent island building, and noted that Vietnam’s projects comprised just 60 acres of new land over several years. This acknowledgment was important because it made clear that the scope of China’s activities, rather than land reclamation as a technique, was Washington’s worry. It also lent credibility to the contention that China’s island building was unprecedented in speed and scale.

The next big, fact-based move was the Pentagon’s decision to allow a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/26/politics/south-china-sea-navy-surveillance-plane-jim-sciutto/">CNN</a> reporter to join a P-8 surveillance flight over the Spratlys and to declassify the video. The video included stunning footage of Fiery Cross, Mischief, and Subi Reefs. These artificial islands looked much like they do in satellite photos, but the video captured dregders in motion and construction under way, and in so doing conveyed the dynamism of China’s work. More importantly, it also captured several warnings by Chinese military personnel to the U.S. aircraft to leave the “military zone” it was approaching; the U.S. pilot responded that he was in international airspace and in compliance with international law. In this exchange, the Pentagon and CNN made palpable the most serious danger in the current Spratly standoff. Other states do not know what China believes its rights to be around its new outposts. And while many (including the United States) believe that China cannot claim sovereign territory, maritime entitlements, or national airspace based on this building, a major accident could occur if China behaves otherwise. This video clip communicated the national security stakes in the South China Sea better than any official pronouncement could.

The South China Sea portion of Carter’s Shangri-La speech <a href="http://www.defense.gov/Speeches/Speech.aspx?SpeechID=1944">tracked with remarks</a> the Secretary made at the PACOM change-of-command ceremony in Honolulu two days prior. When speaking to the international Shangri-La audience, however, Carter did not simply rebuke China’s actions—he built his criticism on facts. His <a href="http://www.defense.gov/Speeches/Speech.aspx?SpeechID=1945">Shangri-La speech</a> repeated the estimate that China had built 2,000 acres of new land in 18 months, and noted that international concerns came from uncertainty about Beijing’s intentions. Carter listed the number of outposts that each South China Sea claimant holds in the Spratly Islands, and acknowledged that others had built on their islands too. He called for a halt on land reclamation by <em>all </em>claimants, including China, and will <a href="http://www.ksl.com/?nid=235&amp;sid=34872953&amp;title=us-defense-secretary-to-ask-vietnam-to-end-land-reclamation">reportedly</a> raise the issue with Vietnam directly. And while reiterating the United States’ longstanding list of interest in the South China Sea, he also invoked international law to articulate Washington’s present and most pressing concern: “After all, turning an underwater rock into an airfield simply does not afford the rights of sovereignty or permit restrictions on international air or maritime transit.” So why all the facts when the world was watching?

The Pentagon and the administration are well aware that they need regional buy-in to implement any new ideas in the South China Sea. Precisely because the United States does not have claims in these waters but seeks to protect lofty principles, any Washington-led policy necessarily requires support from allies and partners. Countries in South East Asia are keenly aware that there are decades of history behind these disputes. They know that other claimants besides China have built up and reclaimed land features and even built airstrips. Moreover, many countries in the region are wary of being put in a position in which they are forced to choose between the United States and China. A fact-based assessment allowed states like Malaysia to express their deep concerns about China’s activities, while still acknowledging that the situation is complicated. A unilateral rebuke would have been counterproductive.

Another audience for Carter’s speech was, of course, China itself. The fact-based approach allowed the Secretary to be critical of Beijing without provoking ire. The South China Sea section of his speech was nested in a broader edifice of reassurance: the theme, after all, was that all states in the region should be able to rise if they do so peacefully. Carter also included mention of the two CBMS the United States and China signed in late 2014, and noted that the two planned to complete the air-to-air encounters annex later this year. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015-05/31/content_20870308.htm">issued a six-point retort</a> to Carter’s statement that its island building is “out of step” with international rules,  but many members of the Chinese delegation said that they found Carter’s tone to be <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/defense-chiefs-clash-over-south-china-sea-1432949322">“acceptable.”</a>  These delegates were presumably prepared to barrage the Secretary with accusations of “hegemonism” and “zero sum” thinking, but they had relatively few opportunities to use them. Unlike last year’s conference, U.S.-China plenary exchanges did not escalate the tensions of the last several weeks.

This is not to say that Carter’s facts charted the way forward in the South China Sea. There is a good deal more work to be done, including when it comes to the way the United States deploys information about this and other regional disputes. Carter took a strong stand on freedom of navigation, declaring: “The United States will fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows, as U.S. force do all over the world. America, alongside its allies and partners in the regional architecture, will not be deterred from exercising these rights—the rights of all nations.”  As my colleague <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/defense-chiefs-clash-over-south-china-sea-1432949322">Bonnie Glaser</a> has noted, however, Carter didn’t connect the dots to explain clearly that the United States fears that China may already be using its artificial islands to interfere with these rights. The P-8 video demonstrated that freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea may already be contested. Yet Chinese officials insist that China has never interfered with freedom of navigation, and that this is a spurious concern. The PLA’s Senior Colonel Xiaozhuo Zhao did so at Shangri-La and did not meet with much resistance.

If the United States want to sustain international momentum on this issue it should catalogue instances in which it believes freedom of navigation has been threatened and make this data public. It should also scale up this transparent approach and apply it to the region as a whole. If the Pentagon’s $425 million Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative is funded, an early priority should be spending some of those dollars on partner maritime domain awareness capabilities. This would help to reduce the risk of accidents in the South China Sea, and would mean that the United States is not the sole provider of facts. Washington’s narrative will be stronger if it is supported by other regional voices.

It is also, of course, the case that a nuanced narrative is not a master strategy. There is <a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-06-01/china-s-military-isn-t-worried-about-obama">evidence to suggest</a> that the PLA does not believe that the United States will take a harder line on its South China Sea pursuits any time soon. Carter’s speech will only be an unqualified success if it lays the groundwork for bigger things to come.

We at the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative are big fans of fact-based approaches. They are particularly important in the maritime domain, where events at sea can be particularly difficult to monitor. Transparency in the U.S.-China relationship may be easier said than done, however. As the dominant power that has helped to write many of the rules in the international system, the United States has ample incentive to be forthcoming about its actions and intentions. As a rising power that is rapidly gaining strength, China believes it has reason to play a closer hand. China may continue to try to create facts on the ground, but if the United States and others in the region continue to collect and publish data on the security situations, these won’t constitute <em>fait accomplis</em>. Transparency alone certainly will not solve the sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea, but it can help to manage them.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani proposed a “Shangri-La Dialogue Initiative” (SDI) at this year’s Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore. To build foundation for deeper security collaboration with regional partners, Nakatani proposed crisis management though the promotion of common rules and law in the maritime and air domains, maritime and air security through the enhancement of regional maritime domain awareness (MDA), and confidence-building through the improvement of regional disaster response capability.

Nakatani proposed the SDI after explaining the new U.S.-Japan Defense Guidelines and the on-going national security legislation reform. Japan has played an important role in South China Sea issues, particularly in terms of capacity building. As its role is expected to expand under the new Guidelines and legislation, the SDI indicates how Japan will expand its engagement in the troubled waters of the South China Sea.

The SDI is a follow-up of the “three principles for the rule of law,” proposed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the 2014 Shangri-La Dialogue. In view of rising territorial and maritime tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, Abe called for countries to make and clarify claims based on international law, to avoid using force or coercion in resolving conflicts, and to seek to settle disputes by peaceful means. Putting these three principles of the rule of law into practice is essential for the stability of the Indo-Pacific region. In reality, however, there is no consensus on the legal basis for maritime boundaries in postwar Asia. The national sea boundaries in Asia are based on the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty signed between Japan and 48 other countries, but those countries not party to this treaty are not bound by its provisions.

There is no universal interpretation of the law of sea, either. Interpretations of the law of the sea vary by country, for example, on the extent to which coastal countries can restrict the innocent passage of foreign vessels through territorial waters and on whether coastal countries possess jurisdiction in terms of security within exclusive economic zones. These disagreements have at times sparked diplomatic confrontation and precarious encounters between military forces.

There is, therefore, a pressing need for crisis management, MDA, and confidence-building to maintain good order at sea. This is why the SDI calls for those measures. A crisis management mechanism must be established in the region to avoid miscalculation and control escalation. Japan and China are about to agree on maritime/air communication mechanism between defense authorities. The next step is to establish a code of conduct in the maritime and air domains. Similar efforts are being made between the United States and China, and between ASEAN and China. These efforts are designed to manage crises through the application of existing international law (UNCLOS) and international rules (such as COLREGS and CUES). If they prove successful, they will contribute substantially to establishing the rule of law in Asian seas.

Crisis management at sea is difficult without knowing what is going on over the horizon. The missing of MH370 indicates the lack of regional maritime situational awareness. The enhancement of regional MDA is therefore urgent. In this regard, Japan will continue to help build capacity of regional partners. Japan has thus far limited its maritime surveillance to surrounding sea areas but, it will be also able to conduct maritime surveillance in the South China Sea and elsewhere to develop more accurate maritime situational awareness in Asia.

South China Sea dangers are compounded by a lack of regional trust. Regional countries need to build trust by building confidence first. As the region often suffers from massive disasters, disaster relief cooperation provides lots of opportunities for goodwill exchanges, capacity building, combined trainings, and saving lives. Disaster relief cooperation is also good in terms of clearing the suspicion China and some ASEAN countries may have about Japan’s new security policy and proactive engagement in the South China Sea disputes.

China’s rapid and massive land reclamation in the Spratly Islands, coupled with more frequent submarine operations, is intensifying the tension in the South China Sea. As the United States prepares operational assertions within 12 nautical miles from Chinese artificial islands, chances for military confrontation and escalation are becoming higher. Under the new U.S.-Japan Defense Guidelines and security legislation, Japan may be involved in a South China Sea contingency either through logistical support for U.S. military or even collective defense. Under such a circumstance, the SDI is not rhetoric but a strategic objective for Japan.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Carter on the South China Sea: Committed and (Mostly) Clear</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Defense Secretary Ashton <a href="http://www.defense.gov/Speeches/Speech.aspx?SpeechID=1945">Carter’s remarks</a> at the Shangri-La Dialogue on May 30 amounted to a robust, but measured, defense of the United States’ rebalance to the Asia Pacific and its commitment to remain a Pacific power. The speech covered a <a href="http://amti.csis.org/carter-defends-the-south-china-sea-at-shangri-la/">broad spectrum</a> of U.S. commitments to the region—economic, political, and security—before concluding with an enthusiastic articulation of the United States’ interests in the South China Sea and commitment to pursue them.

The secretary’s visit to Singapore was bookended by trips to Honolulu for the swearing in of Harry Harris as the new commander of U.S. Pacific Command and to Vietnam for meetings with Defense Minister Phung Quang Thanh and other officials. During each, Carter voiced a consistent message that the United States has three major interests in the South China Sea—peaceful resolution, protection of freedom of navigation, and preservation of international law—and is committed to pursuing them.

Carter’s consistent messaging was a welcome step toward convincing both Asian and U.S. audiences that the administration is committed to opposing aggression and defending perceived rights in the South China Sea. He refused to back away from an issue that has become particularly contentious in recent weeks—operations by U.S. ships and planes to assert the right to freedom of navigation and overflight in contested waters. At Harris’s swearing-in, <a href="http://www.defense.gov/Speeches/Speech.aspx?SpeechID=1944">Carter insisted</a> that “the United States will fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows, as we do all over the world.” He used nearly identical language three days later at the Shangri-La Dialogue, and <a href="http://www.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=5631">reiterated it to the media</a> during his flight between and during a press conference following his meeting with Defense Minister Thanh.

But while the determination was unmistakable, what was missing from Secretary Carter’s message was a clear articulation of how claimants’ actions, including artificial island building, threaten international law, why such a threat constitutes a challenge to U.S. national interests, and what specific purpose would be served by proposed “freedom of navigation operations” near certain features. In other words, the trip accurately conveyed U.S. convictions, but not the rationale behind them. In the case of proposed freedom of navigation operations in particular, this has allowed opponents to <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-gambit-risks-sucking-it-into-conflict-with-china-1431505129">argue against straw-men</a>, whether purposely or not based on misunderstandings of what the Pentagon is actually considering and why.

To be clear, the Department of Defense is considering sending ships or planes within 12 nautical miles of <em>only</em> those features China has reclaimed that were originally below water at high-tide and not within 12 nautical miles of any other features. This would mean only Mischief Reef and Subi Reef. Nor has this happened yet, despite misrepresentations in the press and by some analysts over where a much-publicized <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/20/politics/south-china-sea-navy-flight/">P-8 flight</a> occurred two weeks ago. Such a limited operation would have a very clear purpose in asserting that artificial islands are entitled to only a 500 meter safety zone, not a 12 mile territorial sea. More importantly, it would put yet another <a href="http://cogitasia.com/furthering-u-s-strategic-goals-in-the-south-china-sea/">bit of pressure</a> on China to clarify the scope and basis of its ambiguous claims.

Carter danced around this clarification at several points during his trip. He told a reporter during his flight to Singapore that the right to a 12 mile territorial sea “does not pertain to features that were submerged, and now are no longer submerged.” And at the Shangri La Dialogue he quipped, “After all, turning an underwater rock into an airfield simply does not afford the rights of sovereignty or permit restrictions on international air or maritime transit.” But the link between that fact of international law and the Pentagon’s proposed freedom of navigation operations was left implicit, and therefore lost on those not well-versed in U.S. naval operations and maritime law.

In fairness, no trip can accomplish everything, and Carter’s message was meant first and foremost to reassure the region about U.S. commitment. The next step must be explaining the how and why. The Pentagon, and the administration at large, must better explain the threat posed to the global maritime commons and international law by China’s extensive claims, and why forcing a clarification of claims is such a vital part of U.S. interests in the sea. Only then will the value of things like freedom of navigation operations make complete sense, and get more robust support both at home and in the region.

And to that end, U.S. policymakers must also be clearer that other claimants will be held to the same standard as China, and any violations of international law they make will be challenged just as vigorously. Carter made an excellent start on that process during his meeting with Defense Minister Thanh, who he urged to forego any further reclamation on Vietnamese-occupied features. The minister made no such promise publicly, but his <a href="http://www.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=5632">defense of Vietnamese activities</a> made clear that the two had a candid discussion on the topic.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Temperature in Canberra as the South China Sea Boils</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By various accounts, policy is firming up in Australia on what to do about the South China Sea – specifically, whether Canberra should take an unambiguous stand on the destabilising impact of China’s island-building activities.

Australian policymakers are not fooled by the surface calm with which discussions concluded at the recent Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore.

Although most international attention was rightly focused on the more uncompromising elements of the speeches by US Defense Secretary Carter and Chinese Admiral Sun, the words of Australian Defence Minister Kevin Andrews in Singapore were also unusually forthright.

<a href="http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/2015/05/31/minister-for-defence-114th-iiss-asia-security-summit-the-shangri-la-dialogue-singapore/">He emphasised</a> that his country had a legitimate interest in the South China Sea, notably in terms of maintenance of peace and stability, respect for international law, and freedom of navigation. The <a href="http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/2015/05/30/minister-for-defence-japan-us-australia-defense-ministers-meeting-joint-statement/">wording of a statement</a> he agreed trilaterally with the United States and Japan was stronger still:

“They underscored their shared interest in the maintenance of peace and stability; respect for international law; commitment to upholding freedom of navigation and overflight; [and] unimpeded commerce in the East China and South China Seas. They expressed strong opposition to the use of coercion or force to alter the status quo in the East China and South China Seas unilaterally and their serious concern over Chinese land reclamation activities in the South China Sea.”

Australia cannot pretend that what happens in the South China Sea is none of its business, and nor does it intend to.

Even one of Australia’s most prominent advocates of a more accommodating approach to the rise of China, Professor Hugh White, recognizes in his book <a href="http://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/why-us-china-grand-bargain-asia-would-fail">The China Choice</a> that to concede control of the South China Sea to Beijing “would be to concede more than is compatible with the vital interests of other great powers”.

The longer those other powers – including the United States, Japan, and India – hesitate in making their views known, the higher the stakes of confrontation the will rise, or the greater the regional precedent of change being wrought through coercion rather than consultation.

As a middle power, Australian security ultimately depends on a rules-based regional order and one in which the interests of multiple powers are respected. Damage to that order through coercion or unilateral assertiveness as we have seen in these contested waters in recent years, equates with damage to Australian interests.

Australia’s lifelines, its trade routes to and from some of its top trading partners, including China but also Japan and South Korea, run through or close to those waters – as do the sea lanes on which the commerce of much of the world depends.

The tensions in the South China Sea are testing American resolve, credibility and diplomatic dexterity. The United States is the ally on which Australian security deeply depends, and therefore these are tests for Australia too.

As the Indo-Pacific region comes to terms with how to incorporate a powerful China's legitimate interests, the way China behaves when its interests brush up against those of small powers provides a test-case for all to watch closely.

The looming question remains what will Australia do. Doing nothing is not an option, unless smaller powers are prepared to enable a might-is-right precedent in their region.

So can we expect Royal Australian Navy ships or RAAF aircraft at some point to pass close by the artificial islands as part of their normal activity in the region, as is their right under international law? Will Australia do this alone or in company with others?

Significantly, Australian Defence Minister Andrews has given public indications that Australia reserved the right to continue to exercise the freedom of navigation and overflight its navy vessels and surveillance planes have made use of for decades in international waterways in Southeast Asia. To <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/south-china-sea-australia-will-ignore-chinese-air-defence-zone-says-kevin-andrews-20150601-ghe7o1.html">portray this as continued</a>, not fundamentally new, behaviour is both accurate and smart.

There are <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/foreign-affairs/flight-exercises-to-test-china-waters/story-fn59nm2j-1227378837148">media reports</a> that Canberra is considering is weighing up both the immediate risks and long-term strategic signal of resolve that could arise from a deliberate freedom of navigation operation in the near future.

A second option could be for Australia to explore creative, oblique ways to show China that the island-building is harmful to its interests, without raising the risk of an encounter or challenge at sea or in the air. For instance, Australia could step up its activism in convening new bilateral security partnerships or even ‘minilateral’ security dialogues of three or more countries, involving other powers concerned about the way China is using its power, such as India or Japan or Southeast Asian partners. This could be projected as a clear sign to China that its behaviour is bringing about the very outcome it does not want – a firmer balancing alignment of other regional powers.

A third option could be for Australia to focus on bilateral diplomacy and the impact of words. After all, there is the precedent of Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop’s firm opposition to China’s destabilising declaration of an ‘air defence identification zone’ over waters contested with Japan in 2013.  In that instance Australia weathered China’s diplomatic displeasure, an experience that has arguably strengthened Australia resolve and self-respect in handling differences with its largest trading partner.

Now China has refocused its assertiveness from a defiant Japan towards smaller countries in the South China Sea, and has to some extent modified its game from initiating risky close-range sea and air encounters to the more passive aggressive tactic of island-building.

That unfortunately places the burden of risk on other powers, as symbolised recently by the flight of a US surveillance plane, complete with TV camera crew, close to the artificial islands. This was challenged by Chinese forces who ordered the plane to leave an alleged ‘military zone’ lest there be ‘miscalculation’ – as if any subsequent deliberate use of force by China could be construed as an accident.

All this goes to the balance of risks and uncertainties about where the United States and other like-minded countries, including Australia, proceed from here.

In Singapore, US Secretary of Defense Carter wisely linked US forces’ right to exercise freedom of navigation and overflight to the rights and interests of others in the region, including small and medium powers.

This means, however, that such operations will be more effective if they are not conducted solely by the United States – and if they are accompanied by wider diplomatic initiatives, supported by diverse regional and global partners, to categorically disprove the Chinese propaganda line that this is all about ‘meddling’ and ‘hegemony’. Australia can be an important partner in such efforts, although it should not be the only one.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[President Benigo Aquino III’s first state visit to Japan reflected the increasing tempo of security cooperation between these two U.S. allies that are facing a common security challenge in their maritime domains—China’s maritime expansion. President Aquino met Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to discuss how they can strengthen their countries’ strategic partnership in the face of China’s aggressive behavior in the South China Sea. In the first day of his visit, President Aquino signed a contract with Japan United Corporation for the acquisition of ten patrol vessels for the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG). Funded by the Japan International Cooperation (JICA), the Japan United Cooperation will build ten 40-meter long multirole response vessels (MRRVs) that will be delivered to the PCG starting 2016. With their top speed of 16 knots and a range of 1,500 miles, the MRRVs will be deployed in the Coast Guard Districts across the country including in the island of Palawan—the country’s most western part that faces the South China Sea. The deal also includes the supply of standard spare parts and tools, crew training, ocean transportation, and marine insurance.

The following day, President Aquino and Prime Minister Abe signed a Joint Declaration. The five-page document provides a strategic vision to the two countries’ evolving security partnership. It also expressed their commitment to ensure maritime safety and security, including in the South China Sea, and also their serious concern on unilateral actions to change the status quo in the South China Sea including large-scale reclamation and building of outposts. This is directed against China’s constructions of artificial islands in the South China Sea.

The declaration includes a detailed action plan for strengthening the two countries’ strategic partnership. Among the areas of cooperation are information sharing on security environment and challenges, information exchange and policy coordination on respective security policies, cooperation on maritime security, including maritime domain awareness, humanitarian assistance, and most significantly, the provision of defense equipment and technology cooperation. A significant aspect of document is the two countries’ decision to negotiate an agreement for the transfer of Japanese defense equipment and technology to the Philippines. In January 2015, Philippine Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin made a three-day visit in Japan and handed to his Japanese counter-part, Gen Nakatani a wish-list for the AFP that included P-3C Orion patrol aircraft and other radar related equipment.

On June 5, President Aquino announced that the two countries would soon start talks on a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) that would allow the Japanese Self-Defense Force (SDF) access to Philippine military bases. In a press briefing in Tokyo, President Aquino revealed that Japanese and Filipino officials discussed the possibility of SOFA since both countries have boosted their security relationship significantly over the past few years. In early June 2013, Secretary Gazmin raised the possibility of allowing ships and planes of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) access to the former American military facilities in the Philippines if Tokyo is interested in negotiating and signing an access agreement with Manila. The possible SDF use of Philippine bases on a limited and rotational basis would be useful for Japan as it actively pursues a policy of Pro-Active Contribution to Peace in East Asia. With refuelling and basing facilities in the Philippines, units of the Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) and MSDF can conduct joint patrols with their American counter-parts for a longer period of time and over a larger area of the South China Sea.

Prior to President Aquino’s visit to Tokyo, the Philippine Navy and the MSDF held a joint naval exercise in the South China Sea as an indication of the two country’s growing security partnership. In early May 2015, two MSDF destroyers—the JS Harusame and Amigri--conducted a training exercise with a Philippine Navy (PN) frigate BRP Ramon Alcaraz on communication strategies to respond to “unplanned encounters at sea.” Known as the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES), the MSDF-PN joint naval exercise was part of a security agreement signed by Tokyo and Manila in January 2015 aimed at tightening security cooperation between the two U.S. allies. Security analysts noted the significance of this low-key naval exercise as this signalled Japan’s growing interest in the region in the light of Tokyo’s plan to assist the U.S. 7th Fleet in patrolling the South China Sea.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Why Does China’s Maritime Claim Remain Ambiguous?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There are lots of criticisms that China’s claims in the South China Sea are ambiguous. For example, it has been criticized for "failing to honor" the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea despite being a signatory to it, as well as for "violating" other international laws on the sea. China has never defined what the Nine-Dash Line included or excluded. A few international observers also accuse China of deliberately obscuring its territorial claims in the South China Sea by using terms not found in the UNCLOS, such as "adjacent waters" and "relevant waters". And some countries keep demanding that China "clarify" its Nine-Dash Line map. Why and to what extent do China’s claims remain ambiguous? Objective analysis will conclude that China has an unequivocal and consistent territorial claim to islands and other land features in the South China Sea, despite a certain ambiguity in its maritime claims.

China has an unequivocal and consistent territorial claim on the islands and other land features in the South China Sea. As a matter of fact, it has unequivocally stated its claim in three official documents: the 1947 Location Map of the South China Sea Islands released by the Kuomingtang government in Nanjing, the 1958 Declaration of the Government of New China on the Territorial Sea, and the 1992 Law on Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone. These documents state that the Dongsha (Pratas) Islands, Xisha (Paracel) Islands, Zhongsha (Macclesfield Bank/Scarborough Shoal) Islands, Nansha (Spratly) Islands and other islands are part of the sovereign territory of China.

Some countries view China's maritime claim in the South China Sea as ambiguous for historical reasons. The first reason is that the UNCLOS does not properly address the issue of historic rights. Despite the reference to historic title in Articles 15 and 298(1)(a), the provision on historic bays in Article 15(6), and the recognition of traditional fishing rights in Article 51, it does not have any provision for the definition of historic rights or their specific connotation and denotation.

The second is that no consistent understanding has been reached in international law on historic rights. For example, Yehuda Z. Blum, an Israeli professor of law and diplomat, has observed: The term "historic rights" denotes the possession by a state, over certain land or maritime areas, of rights that would not normally accrue to it under the general rules of international law, such rights having been acquired by that state through a process of historical consolidation ... Historic rights are a product of a lengthy process comprising a long series of acts, omissions and patterns of behavior which, in their entirety, and through their cumulative effect, bring such rights into being and consolidate them into rights valid in international law.” A state acquires historic rights through effective exercise of these rights by one or more states, a practice followed by relevant states. The concept of historic rights is almost equivalent to that of historic water. In this vein, Leo Bouchez, a renowned international law professor, says the concept of "historic rights" has evolved from the concept of "historic water" and "historic bays". The development from "historic bays" to "historic water" and from "historic title" to "historic rights" indicates the evolution of legal concepts with the development of state practice, and that such concepts have not been finalized.

From the point of view of China, one of the world's oldest civilizations, the South China Sea is part of the traditional Asian order and, hence, it would be inappropriate to comprehend the Nine-Dash Line by relying solely on the Westphalian nation-state system.

As Keyuan Zou, Harris professor of International Law at the University of Central has observed, the South China Sea Nine-Dash Line map was officially released by the Chinese Kuomingtang government half a century before the UNCLOS, and one decade before the 1958 Four Geneva Conventions on the Law of the Sea. Thus, China's historic rights within the Nine-Dash Line cannot be ignored. The Nine-Dash Line drawn by the Chinese government in 1947, at approximately the median position between China's South China Sea islands and reefs and the coastlines of bordering states, reflects the scope of China's claims. The consistency of the claims has been maintained by China after 1949, and the claims have been recognized or acquiesced to by bordering states over a long period of time. Therefore, the Nine-Dash Line has probative force and weight under international law.

The so-called ambiguity in China's Nine-Dash Line map and its claim on the waters within that line mainly stems from the imperfection of the UNCLOS. To some extent, international law on historic rights is defective in theory and doctrine and lacks a unified standard. China has been striving to clarify its claim in the South China Sea. But the joint efforts of the international community are also needed to complement and improve the UNCLOS by agreeing to a new international convention or protocol in order to clarify the understanding of historic rights.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Massive Island-Building and International Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Within the short span of a year, China’s rapid construction of artificial islands in the disputed Spratlys has radically changed the geographical and security landscapes in the South China Sea.

This island construction has so far created over eight million square metres of real estate in the open sea, outstripping other countries’ reclamation activities by far, and shows no sign of abating. Hundreds of millions of tons of sand and coral have been dredged from the seabed and dumped atop fragile coral reefs that are vital components of the maritime ecology. Marine experts expect that the work has already caused disastrous and essentially irreversible environmental impacts.

The newly created and enlarged islands will be infrastructure that facilitates China’s projection of force and assertion of control not just in the disputed Spratlys area but also over most of the South China Sea, deep into the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) that by any reasonable interpretation of international laws on maritime delimitation would rightfully belong to other countries. Although conflicting claims have existed over the islands and these EEZs for decades, a precarious balance has endured until now partly because China’s nearest military infrastructure is hundreds of miles further to the north. Defence planners in other claimant countries now have to face a future without this protection by distance.

Another concern is whether China will to use the newly created or enlarged islands to attempt to make new maritime claims. First, China might well claim a 12-nautical-mile territorial sea, or some sort of vague “military alert zone”, around each of Mischief Reef and Subi Reef, which would infringe on the international community’s the freedom of navigation and overflight that currently exists these areas. Second, China might assert territorial seas around other newly created or enlarged islands that are close to islands being garrisoned by other countries, which would bring it into direct conflicts with the other claimants. Third, the creation and enlarging of the islands may embolden China in its claim for EEZ for the entire Spratly archipelago, exacerbating the maritime disputes in the region.

China justifies the island building by arguing that <em>“China's activities on relevant islands and reefs of the Nansha Islands fall entirely within China's sovereignty and are totally justifiable.”</em><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a> Some analysts have argued further that it is not breaking any maritime law. However, these arguments can be shown to be flawed in a number of respects.

First, Fiery Cross Reef, Johnson South Reef, Cuarteron Reef, Hughes Reef and Gaven Reef are the subjects of a sovereignty dispute. It is therefore bad faith for a claimant to completely and irreversibly alter their geographical characters. If one day an international court is given the jurisdiction to resolve the dispute and rules that these islands belong to a country other than China then the damage to these reefs from today’s island building activities has already and irretrievable impaired that country’s rights.

Second, since Mischief Reef and Subi Reef in their natural state are under water at high tide and more than 12 nautical miles from other islands, customary international law does not allow any country to claim sovereignty over them. Therefore the island building activities at these reefs cannot be within China’s sovereignty. Furthermore, it would be illegal for China or any country to claim sovereignty over the newly created artificial islands at these locations.

Third, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) does not allow China to use the artificial islands at Mischief Reef and Subi Reef to claim 12-nautical-mile territorial seas or EEZs beyond: artificial islands are only entitled to a safety zone that can extend to at most 500 metres.

Fourth, China is violating UNCLOS articles 192 and 123, which are on the protection of the marine environment, especially in enclosed and semi-enclosed seas such as the South China Sea. Article 192 states that <em>“States have the obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment”</em>, while article 123 requires the countries bordering an enclosed sea to <em>“coordinate the implementation of their rights and duties with respect to the protection and preservation of the marine environment”</em>. While each of the parties in the Spratlys dispute would naturally think that it, and it alone, has the rights to build on the disputed islands and reefs, it is undeniable that they all have a duty to protect and preserve the marine environment of the semi-enclosed and environmentally vulnerable South China Sea.

In its 2003 ruling on the Malaysia vs Singapore dispute over the latter’s reclamation activities, the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) directed<em> “Singapore not to conduct its land reclamation in ways that might cause irreparable prejudice to the rights of Malaysia or serious harm to the marine environment, taking especially into account the reports of the group of independent experts.” </em>Singapore complied with the tribunal’s ruling. China, however, has completely disregarded it obligations to UNCLOS by dredging hundreds of millions of tons of sand and coral from the seabed and dumping them over eight million square metres of coral reefs that are vital fish spawning grounds, without any assessment by independent experts, and without any coordination or even consultation with other littoral countries.

Fifth, the fact that the Spratlys area is subjected to territorial and maritime disputes brings us to another violation of UNCLOS. Articles 74 and 83 of the Convention requires that in areas of conflicting EEZ or extended continental shelf claims, the claimants <em>“in a spirit of understanding and cooperation, shall make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements of a practical nature and, during this transitional period, not to jeopardize or hamper the reaching of the final agreement.”</em> In its 2004 ruling on the Guyana vs Suriname dispute, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) has interpreted this clause to mean that the claimants are not allowed to unilaterally cause permanent changes to the area under dispute.

By all accounts, Mischief Reef is an area of EEZ under dispute, while Subi Reef could be an area of EEZ or extended continental shelf under dispute, where UNCLOS articles 74 and 83 and the Guyana-Suriname ruling are clearly applicable. The building of islands on Mischief Reef and Subi Reef clearly violates these articles.

Unlike Mischief Reef and Subi Reef, Fiery Cross Reef , Johnson South Reef, Cuarteron Reef, Hughes Reef and Gaven Reef are either naturally above high tide or situated within 12 nautical miles of other islands. According to UNCLOS, they are surrounded by territorial seas. Therefore, China’s island building at these reefs takes place within the territorial seas and it might seem that UNCLOS articles 74 and 83 and the Guyana-Surinam ruling (which apply only to the EEZ and the extended continental shelf) are not relevant. However, a closer look suggests otherwise. It is well known that coral reefs are important fish spawning grounds of the oceans and sea, and their destruction affects fish stock far beyond the reefs’ adjacent waters. Massive island building on reefs can therefore have permanent effects on the EEZ beyond these reefs’ territorial seas. In the case of the Spratlys, that EEZ is disputed, therefore UNCLOS articles 74 and the Guyana-Surinam ruling apply, which means actions that cause permanent changes to that EEZ are illegal even if the actions themselves take place in the territorial sea.

In summary, China’s massive island building is both a provocative alteration of the security situation in the South China Sea and blow for the marine environment, but it cannot be justified either as “<em>entirely within China's sovereignty”</em> or as consistent with maritime law. In fact, if China claims sovereignty over Mischief Reef and Subi Reef and maritime zones based on those features, that will be an audacious attempt to rewrite international law.

		<title>China’s Claims are Unambiguously Ambiguous</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the first paragraph of <a href="http://amti.csis.org/why-does-chinas-maritime-claim-remain-ambiguous/">his recent AMTI article</a>, Zheng Zhihua essentially conflates two issues--questions of sovereignty over islands and questions of jurisdiction over resources and the boundaries delimiting them--when he says:
<blockquote>A few international observers also accuse China of deliberately obscuring its territorial claims in the South China Sea by using terms not found in the UNCLOS, such as “adjacent waters” and “relevant waters”. And some countries keep demanding that China “clarify” its Nine-Dash Line map."</blockquote>
'Territorial claims' are about island and land features in this context, and are not governed by UNCLOS, as we all know by now. Criticism of the use of "adjacent waters" and "relevant waters" is well justified, because these refer not to the land but to the waters and the boundary claims China makes. Right off the bat he mixes the two concepts, but this allows him to implicitly criticize those who criticize China and at the same time to make the following statement:
<blockquote>China has an unequivocal and consistent territorial claim to islands and other land features in the South China Sea, despite a certain ambiguity in its maritime claims.</blockquote>
This is an accurate statement and exactly what we have been challenging China about. Few have heartburn with China's island claims. Whether one believes China's claims to sovereignty over land features is strong or weak--and reasonable people disagree about this point--very few believe China has no rational claim at all. The second paragraph accurately states the point that Beijing (and Nanjing before it) have consistently claimed sovereignty over the land features through China's domestic law and the publication of the Nine-Dash Line.

But the Chinese government remains unambiguously ambiguous about the nature of its maritime claims and their reference, if any, to the Nine-Dash Line. The rest of the piece is devoted to addressing historic rights--but it never hits the issue head on. Does China claim them? If so, what rights? Where? And by what theory?

The rest of the piece is directed at the supposed weakness of the law regarding historic maritime rights. But to say that UNCLOS does not "properly address" historic rights is pretty weak tea, in my view. The entire 20th century process of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea--known as UNCLOS I, II and III, resulted in several treaties. The 1958 Geneva Conventions on the Law of the Sea were agreed after the conclusion of UNCLOS I. The United Nations CONVENTION on the Law of the Sea (also often referred to as UNCLOS or sometimes LOSC or LOST) after UNCLOS III ended in 1982. During this process, the question of historic rights in relation to resource rights was often addressed. Although UNCLOS II resulted in no treaties, it did result in a helpful report on the state of "historic rights" at sea as of 1962. It can be found <a href="http://legal.un.org/ilc/publications/yearbooks/Ybkvolumes(e)/ILC_1962_v2_e.pdf.">here</a>. It is dense but enlightening reading for the brave-hearted non-specialists who want to wander in.

In 1962 there remained no international consensus on resource rights because there were so many approaches world wide--i.e., so many different approaches to "historic rights" in relation to resources. Even in 1958 this question presented serious difficulty--so much so that the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Territorial Sea acknowledges the existence of this zone, but could not even generate agreement about how wide it was and so left that question open. The challenge for the international community between the 1958 conventions and 1982, when UNCLOS III ended, was to create an orderly process for allocating resource rights. It was no easy task because of the tension inherent between extending coastal state rights seaward and the freedoms of navigation and other freedoms that were fundamental to so many states.

By 1982 sufficient consensus was achieved around the concept of a new zone--the exclusive economic zone (EEZ)--that UNCLOS III was able to close with the text of a new convention. China actively participated in the UNCLOS III negotiations and indeed won the day on this point of the EEZ as it was quite active in talking a leadership role among developing states, which by then formed a majority. The negotiating blocs were in fact the "Group of 77" countries--which grew between UNCLOS I and III to more than 120 states, many of them former colonies--pitted against the "West" (US,  Europe) and the "Soviets" (the USSR and associated countries). The latter two groups opposed extending coastal state resource zones in ways that infringed upon navigational and high seas freedoms. So in other words, a grand bargain was struck in the EEZ that was designed, on the basis of consensus, to bring order to the previous patchwork of historical approaches to resource interests while preserving high seas freedoms there to the maximum extent possible.

I should point out that the EEZ has been an extraordinarily successful regime, on the whole. It took another 12 years after 1982, but by the mid 1990's sufficient countries came around to the compromise that UNCLOS came into force in 1994. China signed on in 1996 and <em>made no reservations or signing statements about the EEZ.</em> The EEZ has become nearly universally accepted, even by states such as the US who are not party to the Convention. I only say "nearly" because there are less than 10 countries world wide whose claims are unknown (such as the DPRK and Iran) or remain excessive--such as Peru's continued claim to a 200 mile Territorial Sea (an excellent source for this type of data <a href="http://www.jag.navy.mil/organization/code_10_mcrm.htm">is here</a>).

The International Court of Justice and the United States have even both recognized the existence of the EEZ in customary law. So, it is simply inaccurate to say UNCLOS did not "properly address" historic rights. UNCLOS obviated the need for the existence of historic rights for resources beyond the territorial sea and it included historic rights as part of the process for defining territorial sea baselines. The international community, through the UNCLOS process, therefore "spoke" about historic rights comprehensively. The examples of scholarly statements on historic rights are all consistent with UNCLOS and its limitation of historic rights to baselines and bays.

Nonetheless, Zheng's line of argument has become standard stock among Chinese scholars now. It is the flip side of the EEZ bargain that China is also seeking to undo--the navigational and other high seas freedoms that were made part of the EEZ. They dress up their statements with claims of "ambiguity" or that the law needs to be "perfected." But let's be honest...China finds that the UNCLOS bargain regarding the EEZ does not suit its current interests and objectives. It is therefore trying to except itself from the bargain's requirements. This is not about the imperfections or ambiguities of the law. It is about China's changed interests.

The challenge China has for itself is how to consolidate its near seas interests without undoing its global interests. Globally, the EEZ regime is strongly accepted, including the basic bargain between resources and high seas freedoms. A Chinese attempt to undo the regime would not, shall we say, be an exercise in "smart power." Additionally, China has benefitted by the EEZ extension in many direct and indirect ways. China is the biggest global commercial fishing state because it purchases fishing rights from so many coastal states around the world. China's sea lanes are stable because navies have global access to the EEZ to suppress state and non-state threats to commercial passage. Destroying the regime would probably be impossible and would in any event would be contrary to China's interests beyond the near seas. Accordingly, its best option is to argue for exceptional rights. Hence, it maintains ambiguity about its Nine-Dash Line claims and steadily injects confusion into the conversation about the concept "historic rights." This buys China space and time to pursue consolidation of its near seas interests while dulling he sharper edges of criticism.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On June 16, 2015, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2535_665405/t1273370.shtml">announced</a> that "as planned, the land reclamation project of China’s construction on some stationed islands and reefs of the Nansha (Spratly) Islands will be completed in the upcoming days.” He went on to note that after land reclamation on existing features was complete, China would continue to construct facilities on its new islands. As of June 17, AMTI assesses that two of China's land reclamation projects are fully complete, three are nearly complete, and two are ongoing, with active land reclamation still taking place. The map below shows the current status of China’s Spratly building projects.

<img class=" size-large wp-image-3488 aligncenter" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/chinese_reclamation_map_FINAL-1024x667.jpg" alt="chinese_reclamation_map_FINAL" width="100%"/>

The pictures below, taken between early and mid-June, show ongoing work at Mischief and Subi Reef, with dredging activity still underway. Read on for more information about activity at these reefs. China’s announcement comes as Washington and Beijing prepare to meet for the seventh annual Strategic and Economic Dialogues (S&amp;ED) on June 22-24. This timing, coupled with the fact that five of China’s seven projects were nearly finished, leads <a href="http://amti.csis.org/chinas-land-reclamation-announcement-a-change-in-message-not-in-policy/">CSIS scholars to argue</a> that China’s statement represents a change in message, but not a change in policy.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Mischief-LR.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3494" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Mischief-LR-1024x638.jpg" alt="Mischief LR" width="100%"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Mischief Reef. June 10, 2015.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As of June 10, 2015, extensive dredging was still underway at Mischief Reef, as the pictures display. The northern, western, and southern landmasses constructed in the early Spring of 2015 have been connected and continue to expand and be reinforced with seawalls now ringing the reclaimed reef. In the middle of the feature, dozens of dredgers and support craft transit the inner harbor.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Mischief-Cover1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3497" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Mischief-Cover1-1024x638.jpg" alt="Mischief Cover" width="100%"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Mischief Reef. June 10, 2015.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Reclamation is most active along the northeastern rim of the reef, newly reclaimed since AMTI last released photos of Mischief Reef in March. New structures and construction equipment are visible along the northern bank of the reef. At the southern facility, a seawall is being constructed. AMTI assesses that <strong>5,420,000 square meters</strong> of land have been reclaimed at Mischief Reef as of June 10, 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Subi-LR.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3495" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Subi-LR-1024x638.jpg" alt="Subi LR" width="100%"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Subi Reef. June 5, 2015.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Subi reef has changed dramatically in the last few months. The southern, western, and northern edges of the reef have been reclaimed and an access channel to the inner harbor has been cut out. Most of the reclaimed reef's infrastructure has been built out on the southwestern landmass. Like Mischief reef, the inner harbor is transited by dozens of support craft with active dredgers operating to the north and south of the reef. A naval vessel is visible to the west of the reef. To the east one dredger can be seen expanding the entrance to the reef. Construction is ongoing with two cement plants being built along the western bank and seawalls now extending across the length of the reclaimed land. AMTI assesses that <strong>3,950,000 square meters</strong> of land have been reclaimed at Subi Reef as of June 10, 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Subi-Boats-LR2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3501" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Subi-Boats-LR2-1024x638.jpg" alt="Subi Boats LR2" width="100%"/></a></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Q1: What has China announced about its land reclamation activities in the Spratly Islands?</strong>

<strong>A1: </strong>On June 16, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2535_665405/t1273370.shtml">announced</a> that “as planned, the land reclamation project of China’s construction on some stationed islands and reefs of the Nansha (Spratly) Islands will be completed in the upcoming days.” He noted that after land reclamation was complete, China would continue to construct facilities on its islands.

Kang indicated that China’s position on its island building remained largely consistent. He reiterated that “the construction activities on the Nansha islands and reefs fall within the scope of China’s sovereignty, and are lawful, reasonable, and justified.” Kang also restated that the artificial islands have defense purposes, as well as civilian purposes, including search and rescue, scientific research, ecological conservation, and fishing. Kang <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/t1273539.shtml">declined to offer</a>specific details on which islands were close to complete.

<strong>Q2: Does this represent a resolution of the land reclamation issue?</strong>

<strong>A2: </strong>Today’s announcement does not break new ground with respect to China’s activities or overall position, but it likely reflects subtle diplomatic messaging as senior figures from both the United States and China prepare for high-level meetings. Beijing has already finished its land reclamation activities at some locations in the Spratly Islands, including Johnson South and Fiery Cross Reefs. At other locations, it is putting minor finishing touches on its reclamation work. At two features, Mischief and Subi Reefs, land reclamation is still very much under way. If China were to halt reclamation activity at Mischief and Subi, this would constitute a major change in policy, but this recent announcement appears only to confirm what analysts already knew: Beijing has almost finished its planned land reclamation activities in the Spratlys.

More than anything else, Beijing’s announcement is a shift in its public diplomatic position. Since April, Chinese statements have insisted that other countries have no business interfering with or opining on China’s building activities. Amidst mounting international opprobrium, China’s June 16 announcement is probably intended to mollify the concerns of the United States and of other countries in the region and dial down the rhetorical temperature in the South China Sea.

<strong>Q3: Why now?</strong>

<strong>A3:</strong> The United States and China will hold their seventh annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&amp;ED) <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/06/243835.htm">on June 22–24</a> in Washington, D.C. Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew will be joined by their Chinese counterparts, State Councilor Yang Jiechi and Vice Premier Wang Yang, to discuss the challenges and opportunities in the U.S.-China bilateral relationship. The strategic track of the dialogue will include a subdialogue on maritime security, and the head of China’s State Oceanic Administration will be in attendance. Today’s announcement may help to clear the way for more meaningful discussions in this channel.

Additionally, President Xi Jinping of China will visit Washington in September. The United States and China do not need to break major new diplomatic ground for these visits to be considered successful, but it is best for President Xi if they are not at loggerheads in international headlines when these summits take place.

China may also feel that a tactical release of pressure is timely ahead of Philippine elections and the upcoming Communist Party Congress in Vietnam, both of which take place in 2016. President Benigno Aquino of the Philippines has not used political capital to get a ruling on the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) with the United States from the Philippines Supreme Court, and Beijing may be reverting to a pattern of slowing down for near-term tactical convenience. By pressing hard during the political cycles in the two countries, and fellow South China Sea disputants, who have been the most vocally opposed to China’s reclamation push, Beijing may believe it can avoid providing political advantage to hard-line, anti-China nationalists, who may use China’s aggressive posture in their campaigns for leadership roles.

<strong>Q4: Does this announcement change the military dimension of this problem?</strong>

<strong>A4:</strong> It does not. As Kang’s announcement acknowledged, Beijing will continue to construct facilities on the artificial islands after they are complete. The capabilities that China installs on these islands and how it employs them will determine whether Beijing’s outposts serve peaceful or coercive ends. China has nearly finished construction of a 10,000-foot runway on Fiery Cross Reef, which would allow it to land any aircraft it chooses. It is also installing radar and communications equipment and building large port facilities in the Spratlys. Recent reports <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/30/world/asia/chinese-artillery-spotted-on-spratly-island.html?_r=0">indicated</a> that it had placed mobile artillery on one of its islands. Senior U.S. officials have consistently opposed further militarization by all claimants on land features occupied in the South China Sea, especially the deployment of offensive capabilities. They will presumably continue to do so after China’s land reclamation is complete.

		<title>Modi and the Indian Ocean: Restoring India’s Sphere of Influence</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On a March 2015 trip to Seychelles and Mauritius, Narendra Modi outlined a bold framework that overturned the political approach that India had taken towards the Indian Ocean for half a century.  Beginning in the late 1960s, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi asked all major powers to withdraw from the Indian Ocean out of concern for great power rivalry. This approach fit with India’s self-perception as a non-aligned and Third World state, and its desire to be economically self reliant and to distance itself from the British Raj, which had long been the central security provider in the Indian Ocean.

The context which gave rise to the Gandhi approach began to change in the 1990s, as India embarked on a policy of economic globalization and ended its military isolation. India's new maritime imperatives did not, however, translate into a vigorous national strategy. India’s approach was weighed down by a lack of coherence, political ambivalence, and above all, persistence of a continentalist mindset in Delhi’s security establishment. The top political leadership still had neither the time nor the inclination to lay out clear goals for the Indian Ocean or the maritime space beyond. China, much like India, had long had a continentalist obsession. As China began to build a blue water navy and put its weight behind its own maritime vision for the Pacific and Indian Oceans, however, Delhi was forced to consider the implications for its own maritime security.

India's previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government took a number of new initiatives on the Indian Ocean. It sought to inject renewed dynamism into the moribund Indian Ocean Rim Association that was set up in the 1990s to promote regional cooperation in the littoral. It launched the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium that convenes all the naval chiefs in the littoral for professional exchanges and engagement to promote maritime security. Delhi also initiated a trilateral security arrangement, coordinated at the level of national security advisers, between India, Sri Lanka and Maldives in 2011 to expand maritime security cooperation. Yet, as in so many areas, the UPA government did not have the energy to pursue these initiatives with urgency or purpose. Modi’s recent visit to the Indian Ocean islands has promised to plug that gap between good ideas and their implementation.

Modi’s March 2015 visit to the Seychelles and Mauritius provided him with an opportunity to <a href="http://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/24912/Prime+Ministers+Remarks+at+the+Commissioning+of+Offshore+Patrol+Vessel+OPV+Barracuda+in+Mauritius+March+12+2015">signal</a> that the Indian Ocean littoral is at the “top of [Delhi’s] policy priorities.” In his remarks in Mauritius, Modi laid out a five-fold framework for India’s maritime engagement with the Indian Ocean littoral.

Modi's first principle is that Delhi will do whatever may be necessary to secure India’s mainland and island territories and defend its maritime interests. Since the terror attack on Mumbai at the end of November 2008, Delhi has been acutely conscious of the potential terrorist attacks coming via the sea. At the same Delhi has also been deeply aware of the growing strategic significance of the Indian Ocean in global politics. While the primary focus is on India’s own interests, Modi said, Delhi will “will work to ensure a safe, secure and stable Indian Ocean Region that delivers us all to the shores of prosperity.”

The second dimension of Modi’s framework focuses on deepening security cooperation with regional partners. India has long had close security partnerships with both Seychelles and Mauritius; Modi now wants to elevate these. In Seychelles, <a href="http://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/24895/Prime+Ministers+media+statement+during+his+visit+to+Seychelles+March+11+2015">Modi announced</a> the gift of a second Dornier aircraft for maritime monitoring, signed an agreement for conducting hydrographic surveys, and launched a coastal surveillance radar project. The radar initiative is part of an ambitious project to build a maritime domain awareness network across the Indian Ocean. It calls for the establishment of eight surveillance radars in Mauritius, eight in Seychelles, six in Sri Lanka, and ten in Maldives. These will be linked to over 50 sites on the Indian coast and connected to an integrated analysis center near Delhi. In Mauritius, Modi attended the commissioning of the Indian-made offshore patrol vessel <em>Barracuda</em>, marking his commitment to maritime capacity building in small island republics. He also announced agreements to develop infrastructure for connectivity in the Assumption Island in the Seychelles and Aga Lega in Mauritius. These are likely to strengthen the defense capabilities of the two republics and give India a valuable foothold at critical locations in South Western Indian Ocean.

The third level of Modi’s framework relates to building multilateral cooperative maritime security in the Indian Ocean. Modi said India will help strengthen regional mechanisms in combatting terrorism and piracy and responding to natural disasters. He expressed the hope that Mauritius, Seychelles and other countries will join the trilateral security initiative it already has with Maldives and Sri Lanka. This sets the stage for very productive multilateral maritime security cooperation in the littoral with India at the core. According to some analysts, India’s access to strategic facilities in Seychelles and Mauritius marks a major departure from its traditional opposition to foreign military bases. Although calling these arrangements “bases” might be premature, they point to future possibilities for an expanded Indian strategic footprint in the littoral.

The fourth element of Modi's maritime policy is sustainable economic development.

In Seychelles, Modi announced a joint working group to expand cooperation on the “blue economy” that will increase littoral states' understanding of ecology, resources, and allow them to harness the ocean in a sustainable manner. He also demonstrated considerable sensitivity to climate change concerns in the island nations.

Finally, Modi has discarded India's longstanding reluctance to cooperate with other major powers in the Indian Ocean. While insisting that Indian Ocean states hold the primary responsibility for peace, stability and prosperity in those waters, Modi indirectly referenced the role that the United States plays in the region through dialogue, exercises, economic partnerships, and capacity building efforts.  There can be no doubt that Modi has made a decisive break from the ambivalence of the UPA government. This was evinced during the recent visit of U.S. President Barack Obama, when Modi and Obama announced the renewal of their defense framework agreement and signed a broad framework for expanding cooperation in the Indian Ocean and Asia Pacific.

In Mauritius, Modi reinforced this framework when he declared that “our goal is to seek a climate of trust and transparency; respect for international maritime rules and norms by all countries; sensitivity to each other’s interests; peaceful resolution of maritime issues; and increase in maritime cooperation."  While signaling a new approach to America, Modi has, however, also left the door open for China. His openness towards the U.S. might actually improve Delhi’s strategic bargaining position with Beijing.

In sum, there is no doubt that Modi has embarked on a more ambitious foreign policy in the Indian Ocean. He is determined to build on India’s natural geographic advantages in the littoral. Modi’s India is no longer hesitant about taking a larger responsibility for securing the Indian Ocean and promoting regional mechanisms for collective security and economic integration. It is confident enough to collaborate with the United States in self-interest and engage China on maritime issues with greater self-assurance. Yet it is important to remember that Modi’s vision is only the first step towards rejuvenating Delhi’s Indian Ocean strategy. Modi’s policy will face the familiar test of implementation where Delhi has had multiple problems in the past.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since the middle of May, four vessels of the Indian Navy’s Eastern Fleet, including some of its most advanced indigenous ships, have plied the waters of Southeast Asia and Australia, conducting exercises with partners and making port calls in Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Australia. Some, <a href="http://indiannavy.nic.in/operations/jun-2015-indian-navy-ships-overseas-deployment">not least the Indian government</a>, have held up the deployment as an embodiment of India’s commitment to its new “Act East Policy.” While this may be a fair characterization of the mission’s objectives, it is important to recognize that neither the deployment nor sentiment behind the policy is unprecedented. In doing so, what is truly new – the <em>degree</em> to which India is “Acting East” in the maritime domain – can be more fully appreciated.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the Act East Policy at the November 2014 ASEAN-India summit, <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/11/modi-unveils-indias-act-east-policy-to-asean-in-myanmar/">signaling</a> a desire to increase economic and strategic ties with East Asia. As successor to the “Look East Policy,” which originated in the 1990s and sought to refocus attention on the region, the policy pronouncement is most accurately viewed not as a sudden shift in effort but as recognition of a long-developing trend. It is also a signal that the government will maintain the upward trajectory of deepening ties as it enters a new phase. Within this phase maritime security efforts have played a prominent and important role.

The Eastern Fleet’s annual “operational deployments” or “overseas deployments” throughout East Asia are a prime example. In the 1990s, “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=w2snz5Cfb0gC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">India and her Navy reached out to regional maritime neighbours</a>” with increasing goodwill port calls, augmented the next decade by greater participation in maritime exercises and the start of multi-ship regional deployments. Their presence became <a href="http://indiannavy.nic.in/news-events/ships-during-overseas-deployment">regular features</a> only in the last decade, contributing to the Indian Navy’s reportedly “<a href="http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/indian-navys-operational-tempo-at-all-time-high-admiral-dhowan_1508695.html">all-time high</a>” operational tempo, according to the Chief of the Naval Staff R.K. Dhowan.

In addition to increasing presence, evidence of India’s implementation of the Act East Policy comes from a series of firsts in engagement with nations to the east. Although India’s Navy has for some time helped conduct joint training and enforcement efforts with regional forces – for instance coordinated patrols (CORPATs) with both <a href="http://indiannavy.nic.in/press-release/india-indonesia-exercise-corpat-concludes">Indonesia</a> (since 2002) and <a href="http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/india-thai-navies-carry-out-coordinated-patrol_891627.html">Thailand</a> (since 2005) – the past several years have seen a maturation and proliferation of these efforts. The twice-yearly Ind-Indo CORPATs are <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indiaindonesia-coordinated-patrol-graduates-into-joint-exercise/article5661161.ece">set to develop</a> into more robust exercises this year and will join the growing roster of annual bilateral exercises with Asian nations such as <a href="http://www.indiandefencereview.com/news/first-bilateral-maritime-exercise-between-india-and-japan-jimex-12/">JIMEX</a> with Japan (since 2012) and <a href="http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/andhra_pradesh/Indian-Ships-in-Singapore-for-Joint-Naval-Exercises/2015/05/24/article2830436.ece">SIMBEX</a> with Singapore (since 1999).

Similarly, last week India <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-and-Australia-to-hold-1st-joint-naval-exercise/articleshow/47661927.cms">agreed</a> to hold its first bilateral naval exercise with Australia later this year. The agreement’s venue was historic in its own right and implications for the Act East Policy, coming at the first high-level trilateral maritime security talks between India, Japan, and Australia. While the Indian legs of the trilateral <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/06/india-japan-and-australia-a-trilateral-in-the-making/">may not be as fast-moving</a> as the Australian-Japanese leg, both promise closer cooperation with eastern democracies, such as the “<a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/04/india-and-japan-continue-to-deepen-their-defense-ties/">special global strategic partnership</a>” touted with Japan. Additionally, the trilateral relationship itself would hold considerable regional clout should it sustain its development. This looks likely, at least in the near-term, as the representatives discussed the potential for a trilateral exercise of their own and a second round of talks.

India has also recently agreed to undertake several maritime capacity building efforts beyond training in line with its Act East Policy. For example, in July 2013 <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2013/08/indias-growing-military-diplomacy/">India agreed to build</a> four offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) for the Myanmar Navy, although the timeline for this project is unclear. Of greater strategic importance is the burgeoning effort to bolster Vietnam’s maritime capabilities. In the fall of 2014 <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/28/india-vietnam-idUSL4N0SM2L020141028">India established a $100M line</a> of credit for Vietnam to buy four Indian patrol boats, helping lay the groundwork for the evolution of another relationship to the status of a “strategic partnership.” <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/05/india-and-vietnam-push-ahead-with-strategic-security-cooperation/">Signed memos</a> on defense and coastguard cooperation followed this May during Vietnamese Defense Minister Phùng Quang Thanh’s visit to New Delhi. Further, India <a href="http://www.livemint.com/Politics/bggj1ESJf8LBMO92XHBjtO/India-Vietnam-to-identify-newer-areas-of-cooperation.html">is reportedly</a> in talks to allow Russia to sell their jointly developed BrahMos cruise missile to Vietnam. Perhaps just as important, India has long supplied <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2013/08/indias-growing-military-diplomacy/?allpages=yes">critical spares</a> to Vietnam’s Navy for its vessels of Russian origin.

In addition to these partner-focused efforts, important elements of Act East capacity building begin at home. The tri-service Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), <a href="http://www.firstpost.com/india/india-gets-hawk-eye-over-strait-of-malacca-396918.html">gateway</a> to the Malacca Strait and <a href="http://www.abplive.in/author/nitingokhale/2015/05/24/article597458.ece/Strengthening-the-Andaman-Nicobar-Command">“window into East and South East Asia,”</a> has at last become a priority in the defense budget, for instance receiving funds in 2015 to develop and expand several air and naval stations on the islands. The ANC is also a hub of regional engagement, overseeing the biennial <a href="http://www.indiannavy.nic.in/milan/MILAN-14-Friendship-across-the-Seas.html">MILAN multinational naval exercise</a> while its operational units undertake many of the joint patrols described above.

India’s commitment to developing its own capabilities furthermore provides one of the motivations for the maritime component of the Act East Policy. India has undertaken to expand its military acquisition beyond Russia as default exporter. This is particularly true for those willing to help its “Make in India” campaign, which aims for <a href="http://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/et-commentary/make-in-india-must-help-reduce-import-dependence-of-defence-manufacturing-sector/">a rapid increase in indigenous defense article</a> production and technology transfer defense deals. India's recent amity with Japan may be due in part to the potential to help with several capability challenges, including a likely <a href="http://www.janes.com/article/50147/parrikar-heading-to-tokyo-with-us-2-closer-strategic-ties-on-the-agenda">US-2i amphibious aircraft sale</a> in 2016 and a less likely deal for <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/03/29/national/politics-diplomacy/india-interested-in-buying-japans-soryu-class-submarines/"><em>Soryu</em>-class submarines</a>.

If India's "East" extends to the United States, a similar dynamic emerges. Indian Minister of Defense Manohar Parrikar and U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter on June 3rd signed the new 10-year “<a href="http://i.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/2015-Defense-Framework.pdf">Framework for the U.S.-India Defense Relationship</a>,” an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/25/us-india-joint-statement-shared-effort-progress-all">outgrowth of the meeting</a> between Presidents Obama and Modi in January. It includes a call to “enhance cooperation toward maritime security and to increase each other’s capability to secure the free movement of lawful commerce and freedom of navigation across sea lines of communication.” Such cooperation would build upon the successful 2009 deal to supply India with P-8I maritime patrol aircraft and center initially on India’s development of aircraft carrier technology.

On June 10th, India <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indias-first-indigenous-aircraft-carrier-ins-vikrant-undocked-770479">took out of drydock</a> its Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC) project, the 40,000-ton INS <em>Vikrant</em>, scheduled in 2018 to join the remaining, foreign-built, carrier in the fleet (INS <em>Viraat</em> is slated to retire next year). Although much work remains before <em>Vikrant </em>is operational, the occasion marked the end of another <a href="http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/INS-Vikrant-Ready-to-Float-out/2015/06/11/article2860124.ece">critical stage of production</a> and progress towards an important symbolic achievement – especially as China’s generally more successful indigenous <a href="http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/naval/2015/05/24/chinese-china-navy-naval-plan-warships-shipbuilding-construction-propulsion-power-plant-submarine-aircraft-carrier-destroyer-frigate/27725003/">naval shipbuilding</a> strives to achieve the same in near future. India and the United States in January agreed to form a working group “to explore aircraft carrier technology sharing and design,” which <a href="http://news.usni.org/2015/06/01/u-s-indian-officials-set-to-discuss-aircraft-carrier-design-in-june">meets for the first time</a> in June, with an eye toward to follow-on IAC-II, the planned 65,000-ton <em>Vishal</em>. Of probable interest for the project are nuclear propulsion and the U.S. Navy’s new Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) – a catapult launching system that would incidentally increase the logic for sales of U.S.-built jets.

But what is this capacity for? Responding to China’s growing capabilities and presence in the Indian Ocean is likely another factor driving the Act East Policy. Chinese President Xi Jinping’s <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/02/the-maritime-silk-road-vs-the-string-of-pearls/">Maritime Silk Road initiative</a>, Chinese submarines <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Chinese-submarine-docking-in-Lanka-inimical-to-Indias-interests-Govt/articleshow/45025487.cms">calling in Sri Lanka</a>, and even a <a href="http://www.joc.com/maritime-news/china-denies-backing-asia%E2%80%99s-kra-canal-project_20150520.html">highly speculative canal</a> across Thailand’s Isthmus of Kra with rumored ties to the Chinese government have fuelled fears of the so-called “String of Pearls” strangling India’s sea lines of communication (SLOCs). But the reciprocal eastern Indian presence is likely intended less as a threat than signal that as the Indian Ocean becomes a regular theater of operations for China, so too will East Asia be for India.

The most important factor behind India’s eastern maritime activity is probably economic. The engagement with Vietnam can be explained in large part by the desire to protect India’s investments in oil fields off Vietnam’s coast. India’s joint counter-piracy patrols help shore up its SLOCs, while its ministers regular refer to the importance of the freedom of navigation.

Notably, India has also avoided most issues upsetting to China, maintaining the economic benefits of friendly ties. As evidence, consider Modi’s delicate handling of <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/To-avoid-provoking-China-India-leaves-Japan-out-of-drill-with-US/articleshow/47256369.cms">this year’s U.S.-India Malabar exercise</a> invitations. Japan, a past attendee, is expected to receive an invite after the July planning conference, but Modi’s government was careful not to extend the offer before his May trip to meet with Xi. A similar balancing occurred with two Act East firsts last year when India participated in both the United States-led Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise and <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/india-china-agree-to-deepen-naval-ties-after-landmark-exercise/article5948223.ece">new naval exercises</a> attached to China’s International Fleet Review. While Acting East, India, like most Asian nations, would prefer not have to make a “China choice.” For its part, India is inviting both the United States and China, among dozens of others, to its second <a href="http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/andhra_pradesh/100-Ships-from-60-Nations-Vizag-Braces-for-it%E2%80%99s-Biggest-Fleet-Review-in-2016/2014/07/26/article2349593.ece">International Fleet Review</a> in February next year.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[India’s smaller maritime neighbors are paying close attention as New Delhi consolidates the country’s ambitions in the Indian Ocean. While bolstering its own naval and maritime capabilities, India has actively taken steps to cement partnerships with most of these smaller neighbors in recent years and continues to do so under the Narendra Modi administration. On balance, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, and Myanmar, as well as island nations further west in the Indian Ocean—i.e., Mauritius and Seychelles—benefit from the growth in Indian naval power in considerable ways. At the same time, these countries will occasionally find difficulty in navigating independent policy paths when they are at odds with India’s perspectives.

Among the most high-profile ways in which India’s rising naval capabilities have helped smaller countries in the Indian Ocean is through crisis response operations such as humanitarian assistance/disaster relief (HA/DR) and non-combatant evacuation operations (NEO). <a href="http://www.cna.org/research/2014/improving-us-india-hadr-coordination-indian-ocean">India delivered disaster relief</a> to its Bay of Bengal neighbors prominently after the 2004 tsunami, the 2007 cyclone in Bangladesh, and the 2008 cyclone in Myanmar. More recently, Maldives received vital shipments of drinking water from the Indian Navy and Air Force after a water treatment plant caught fire in December. In the realm of NEOs, the Indian military has evacuated not only Indian nationals from hotspots in the Middle East but also nationals from India’s neighbors, given the large number of South Asians working in the Middle East. For example in April, after the situation deteriorated in Yemen, the Indian Navy and Air Force conducted NEOs of Indian citizens as well as nationals from Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Maldives, among many other countries.

Outside crisis response operations, smaller maritime neighbors benefit from India’s growing naval power through the provision of surface platforms, aircraft, surveillance systems, and training. Countries need these capabilities to perform various maritime security duties such as patrolling their exclusive economic zones (EEZ) and conducting counterpiracy operations. Indian shipyards are currently contracted to build two offshore patrol vessels for Sri Lanka and two fast attack craft and 11 fast interceptor boats for Mauritius. In December 2014, Minister of State for Defence Rao Inderjit Singh delivered the offshore patrol vessel <em>Barracuda</em> to Mauritius, making it India’s first indigenously built ship for export. A month earlier, Indian Chief of Naval Staff (CNS) Admiral R.K. Dhowan gifted a second fast attack craft to Seychelles during his November visit, and during a visit to Seychelles in March 2015 Modi announced plans to donate a second Indian Dornier aircraft. India also supplied landing craft to Maldives in February 2014, in addition to previously donated Dhruv helicopters and fast attack craft. Myanmar has received platforms, equipment, and training from India, including potentially assistance from Indian shipyards in building offshore patrol vessels—although progress is not yet evident.

In addition to the provision of surface platforms and aircraft, India has greatly contributed to increasing smaller countries’ maritime domain awareness capabilities. It is installing coastal radars in <a href="http://www.seychellesnewsagency.com/articles/2542/Defense,+visas+and+the+blue+economy++no+stone+left+unturned+as+Modi+wraps+up+visit+to+Seychelles">Seychelles</a>, Maldives, and Mauritius; conducts EEZ surveillance for these countries; and has expanded information-sharing through its maritime security trilateral with Maldives and Sri Lanka. Seychelles and Mauritius <a href="http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=117542">may eventually join</a> this grouping. In addition to providing training, India also conducts port visits and bilateral exercises with the Sri Lanka Navy; trilateral exercises with the Maldives Coast Guard and Sri Lanka Coast Guard; coordinated patrols with neighboring <a href="http://www.cna.org/research/2012/long-littoral-project-bay-bengal">Bay of Bengal</a> navies Myanmar, Thailand, and Indonesia; and the multinational MILAN maneuvers biennially. With India’s support, neighboring countries’ maritime capacities are being expanded, which promotes regional security and deepens their partnerships with India. On balance, India’s maritime capacity building efforts far exceed <a href="http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/india-still-center-indian-ocean">those of China</a> in Sri Lanka, Maldives, Mauritius, and Seychelles.

<strong>Issues to watch</strong>

Whereas smaller Indian Ocean countries clearly stand much to gain from India’s naval rise, their larger neighbor’s prerogatives sometimes carry undesired weight. For example, Modi did not visit Maldives <a href="http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/Setback-to-Yameen-as-Male-off-PM-Visit/2015/03/07/article2701830.ece">as expected</a> in March 2015 despite having visited other close Indian Ocean island partners on the same trip. Modi’s avoidance of Maldives owes to India’s recent dissatisfaction with President Abdulla Yameen government’s arrest and imprisonment of the former Maldivian president Mohamed Nasheed, whose ties with New Delhi are especially close. It remains to be seen to what extent this divergence between New Delhi and Male could affect the India-Maldives-Sri Lanka maritime trilateral, which did not meet as planned in early 2015 in Maldives.

Relations have improved between India and Sri Lanka in recent years—especially after Modi’s inauguration. One outstanding problem, however, is the protracted dispute between fishermen from southern India and northern Sri Lanka. Both New Delhi and Colombo are in agreement about the maritime boundary line but disagree on the <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/prime-minister-narendra-modi-indian-ocean-tour/article6989218.ece">means of enforcing</a> the line. Repeated talks between fishermen indicate that the problem is nowhere close to being resolved at sea.

<strong>Untapped potential: Bangladesh-India maritime cooperation</strong>

Bangladesh is one country where India could pursue greater maritime capacity-building efforts as it has done with other smaller neighbors. The resolution of their maritime boundary dispute in July 2014 through the Permanent Court of Arbitration has opened up opportunities for naval and maritime cooperation. The Bangladesh Navy and Coast Guard are actively seeking to develop their maritime surveillance and response capabilities <a href="http://www.cna.org/research/2013/us-india-security-burden-sharing">to combat sea robbery and trafficking</a> in the Bay of Bengal. However, India’s military engagement with Bangladesh has focused more on land forces and counterterrorism. Maritime cooperation has been limited, especially when compared with India’s interactions with other Indian Ocean neighbors. Moreover, other major powers dominate as defense suppliers to Bangladesh—for example, the United States provided the Bangladesh Navy with its two largest ships (former U.S. Coast Guard cutters), and China is preparing to sell it two Ming-class submarines.

India can build on the momentum of Modi’s landmark visit to Bangladesh in early June (which saw an MOU signed on coast guard cooperation) by proposing a bilateral naval exercise, annual navy staff talks, and regular coast guard exercises. Another path forward could be for New Delhi to offer to contract Indian shipyards to build surface platforms for the Bangladesh Navy and Coast Guard, as it has done for other countries (increasingly through lines of credit), and even build maritime patrol aircraft (as sold to Mauritius). Such measures would help advance Modi’s broader “Make in India” initiative, specifically by going from “a buyer’s navy” to a <a href="http://www.newswala.com/India-National-News/Indian-Navy-commissions-its-fourth-indigenously-built-patrol-vessel-82432.html">“builder’s navy,”</a> in the words of CNS Admiral Dhowan.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

Smaller Indian Ocean countries are clearly deriving benefits from India’s expanding naval and maritime capabilities. They are grateful for India’s crisis response operations, while India’s capacity building efforts are improving these countries’ maritime forces, thereby advancing regional security and deepening bilateral relationships with New Delhi. Inevitably, India’s predominance in the region will complicate some of these countries’ policy stances, as has been seen in Maldives and Sri Lanka. Smaller neighbors will continue to resist pressure to choose between security partners, preferring instead to benefit from the variety of options presented by the United States, European countries, China, and Japan, among others. On balance, however, these smaller countries have firmly entrenched political-military ties with India, which can be expected to continue to improve as India works to further develop its capabilities in the Indian Ocean.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With six-plus-years of Chinese Gulf of Aden anti-piracy operations and China’s first submarine deployments to the Indian Ocean, considering possible support facilities for the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) isn’t just for those theorizing a “String of Pearls” anymore. The U.S. Department of Defense itself forecasts that within the coming decade Beijing will establish one or more facilities capable of providing significant, if still limited, logistical support. The IOR is attracting increasing Chinese and American attention, with the latest U.S. Maritime Strategy referring to the “Indo-Asia-Pacific” and the previous commander of the U.S. Pacific Command describing its area of operations extending “from Hollywood to Bollywood.” With IOR geopolitics thus receiving growing outside attention, where China will ultimately locate its naval logistics points is an increasingly important question.

Such “places not bases” are unlikely to spring from nowhere. Instead, to plot where China’s navy may be heading the IOR, it helps to review where it’s been. That’s because establishing access points tends to be a long-term endeavor, based on enduring fundaments observable from outside. Naval facilities generally require (1) reliable political support in a stable host nation, (2) robust logistics infrastructure, and (3) sufficient draft for all major ships.

On that basis, the patterns represented in <strong>Exhibit 1</strong> (below) are instructive, but hardly surprising. Leaving aside the potential ports of the future colored in white (many of which receive Chinese investment, but remain under development), several dynamics stand out.

<a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CSIS_AMTI_China-IOR-Basing_20150614_EXHIBIT-1_Ports-for-PLAN.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3522" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CSIS_AMTI_China-IOR-Basing_20150614_EXHIBIT-1_Ports-for-PLAN-1024x768.png" alt="CSIS_AMTI_China IOR Basing_20150614_EXHIBIT 1_Ports for PLAN" width="100%" /></a>

First, only two ports are colored red (indicating more than 20 PLAN port calls): Port Salalah, Oman and Djibouti. Only one is colored yellow (10-20 port calls): Aden, Yemen. In terms of both political support/stability and infrastructure, they are in two separate categories. Oman and Djibouti are both resource-limited oases of stability in geopolitically complex regions which seek economic and political benefits by cultivating positive strategic relations with diverse outside powers. Short of a close political alliance and a society where prosperity undergirds stability yet risk of popular basing opposition is low (to the extent that such a combination exists), those conditions are about as good as it gets for potential IOR host nations. While there is no public discussion of a formal Chinese access point in Oman, Port Salalah has achieved <em>de facto</em> facility status. Aside from China’s first anti-piracy task force (which has only several port calls, by the supply ship only), all twenty thus far have called there. Djibouti has enjoyed nearly as many PLAN visits; now its leader asserts publicly that he has offered China a naval base and that the two sides are in negotiations. By contrast, even before it sunk into civil war, Yemen was clearly less stable. Between observing the USS <em>Cole </em>incident and reviewing China’s own detailed regional knowledge, Chinese planners likely decided not to give Aden equal emphasis with Salalah and Djibouti relatively close by.

Facilities likewise put Salalah and Djibouti in the top tier, over Aden. Salalah supports limited ship repairs. This is nothing to scoff at; few ports in the developing world offer robust repair capacity—a major navy must typically develop its own logistics train. To date, PLAN vessels have typically called on Salalah for replenishment of diesel fuel, water, food, and perishables; as well as crew liberty. Djibouti too allows for limited ship repairs; PLAN ships replenish there. But its infrastructure likely has even greater potential, as the U.S., France, and Japan already enjoy dedicated bases. Its use now suspended indefinitely, Aden until recently offered simpler fare. Another port to watch is Karachi. Pakistan’s foremost commercial and naval port, it has better repair facilities than most in the region. So what could be better than a solid setup on the territory of an “all weather friend”? While the PLAN has already called more than five times there, the next-most after the aforementioned “big three,” only Aden’s virtual closure offers Karachi prospects of gaining third place in PLAN visits. Perhaps Beijing worries about physical security and the appearance of excessively close military interactions with Pakistan, already the subject of serious concern (and far greater media speculation) in neighboring India. Time will tell…

The third key factor informing basing utility is water depth. For a port to be truly useful, it must accommodate a navy’s largest ships. As <strong>Exhibit 2</strong> (below) indicates, the vast majority of ports considered here meet a basic test.

<a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Capture.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3523" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Capture.png" alt="Capture" width="100%" /></a>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Port Depth (meters)</strong></p>
Save for Sittwe, Myanmar, all port listed above easily accommodate the seven-meter draft of the Type 071 <em>Yuzhao</em>-class, currently China’s largest amphibious vessel. Here again, Djibouti and Salalah lead with 18 and 17.5 m respectively. Another port to watch is Victoria, Seychelles, where Foreign Minister Jean-Paul Adam reportedly invited China to establish anti-piracy base in 2012. While Sri Lanka already has 16 and 13 m ports in Colombo and Trincomalee, it is projected to gain a 17 m port when Hambantota comes online over the next decade or so. Tanazania’s planned Bagamoyo port could have 12-14 m draft when completed ca. 2017. The PLAN may well have further options in years to come.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Stirred but Not Shaken: Sri Lanka’s Rebalancing Act</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Shortly after President Maithripala Sirisena’s surprise victory in Sri Lanka’s January Presidential election, the new leader suspended one of the largest Chinese-led infrastructure investments in the country—the $1.5 billion Colombo Port City—and caught the Chinese government off guard. Seemingly in denial, Chinese officials and the media echo chamber downplayed this move as a minor speed bump in the relationship.  Three months later, however, the project <a href="http://nation.lk/online/2015/06/13/port-city-downsizes/">remains suspended</a> and its fate hangs in the balance as a review committee weighs concerns over Sri Lanka’s environment, rule of law, and sovereignty.

China’s inability to move the project forward is not for a lack of trying. Following Sirisena’s visit to Beijing in late March, Chinese media reported one Chinese official declared the suspension was “temporary,” Sri Lanka’s objections had been “<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/26/us-china-srilanka-idUSKBN0MM0KB20150326">sorted out</a>”, and that Sri Lanka had “promised” to continue with construction. Other media outlets began to echo this as fact until a Sri Lankan external affairs minister <a href="http://www.tamilguardian.com/article.asp?articleid=14203">denied</a> it, emphasizing nothing had been decided. An <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/914051.shtml">opinion piece</a> appearing in China’s <em>Global Times </em>titled, “Sri Lanka recognizes value of Chinese Friendship in Post-election Era,” also warned the suspension would jeopardize Sri Lanka’s development prospects and relationship with China. An <a href="http://www.sundaytimes.lk/150329/news/china-shows-it-certainly-knows-what-is-good-for-sri-lanka-142207.html">editorial</a> from a widely read Sri Lankan newspaper responded with the acerbic headline, “China shows it certainly knows what is good for Sri Lanka.”

Though only one instance of China’s insensitivity to local political dynamics, the episode epitomizes China’s misplaced confidence in its strategic foothold in Sri Lanka. Because China tethered itself to the former Rajapaksa government in Sri Lanka, it did not fully appreciate the emergent . Dismissing the critiques as political grandstanding of a small opposition, they were unprepared for the rhetorical and substantive shift in Sri Lanka’s foreign policy.

During the Rajapaksa government, a number of international observers argued Sri Lanka was steadily tilting towards China as one node along its “string of pearls” or “Maritime Silk Road.” This emerging strategic relationship was allegedly motivated by China’s steadfastness during Sri Lanka’s civil war, a desire to offset Indian regional hegemony, and an opportunity for massive development assistance and investment. In Fall 2014, port calls by Chinese submarines into Colombo harbor seemed to confirm this assessment.

Many analysts had overestimated Sri Lanka’s tilt towards China, however, and failed to recognize how shallow and tenuous some of Beijing and Colombo’s links really were.  They also failed to appreciate Sri Lanka’s deep and longstanding economic, military, and social links to India. While the Sirisena government framed its recent maneuvers as a correction back towards India and the West and not an abandonment of China, in zero-sum terms this certainly appears like a win for China’s rivals. Today, a more agile and diversified Sri Lankan foreign policy seeks to cultivate multiple great power patrons and extract as many developmental and strategic benefits as possible while retaining Colombo’s freedom of action.

&nbsp;

<strong>The Limits of Chinese Influence</strong>

Despite the hyperbole surrounding Chinese investment leverage, Sri Lanka’s course correction from its “<a href="http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2015/03/01/main_Editorial.asp">disproportionate</a>” foreign policy should be no surprise. Chinese influence over Sri Lanka was vastly <a href="http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/1750377/passive-investor-partner-crime-how-china-lost-plot-sri-lanka">overstated</a> as its “investments” were actually far less meaningful than perceived. Chinese economic assistance to Sri Lanka often came as soft loans financing white elephant projects—such as Hambantota’s new and <a href="http://www.ft.lk/article/391662/Sri-Lanka-mulls-future-of-Rajapaksa%E2%80%99s-white-elephants--Hambantota-airport--seaport">woefully underutilized</a> airport and seaport—with higher than normal development lending rates and tethered to secret conditions. These infrastructure projects were often unproductive, poorly constructed, inflated in cost due to corruption, and generated few downstream economic benefits. Meanwhile China remained far less consequential in other important domains of Sri Lankan development such as foreign direct investment (FDI), technology transfers, imports, direct aid, remittances, and tourism.

Longstanding and growing Indian influence, even during the Rajapaksa years, also subtly <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2015-04-08/chinas-port-nowhere">counterbalanced</a> China. India was and is still one of the largest sources of direct aid, trade, remittances, and FDI. Furthermore, its military cooperation has expanded since the end of the civil war in 2009, particularly with the Sri Lanka navy. Politically, India has not only wielded influence over social groups in the Tamil North, but also political parties in Colombo. (As an aside, a number of well-informed analysts . Finally India’s steady exchange of tourist, business, and student travel generates substantial people-to-people contacts. India’s leverage and vocal concerns over Chinese overreach in its backyard made Sri Lankan foreign policy recalibration somewhat inevitable.

&nbsp;

<strong>A Rebalanced Strategy</strong>

The string of high profile meetings and agreements in recent months suggest Sri Lanka seeks to navigate multiple major power relationships—including with China, India, and the United States—to reap unique benefits from each without foreclosing on any opportunities.

Sirisena’s first foreign trip of his Presidency to New Delhi acknowledged that India would remain the first among equals in major power relations. India has the potential to boost Sri Lanka’s economic development with private FDI resulting in technology transfers, expanded export capacity, and an improved knowledge economy. Sri Lanka also hopes for assistance with its banking, energy, and maritime sectors. To that end, recent visits by Sirisena to Delhi and Indian Prime Minister Modi to Colombo reaffirmed this “special relationship” with agreements over new economic assistance, expanded free trade to include trade in investment and services, a regional petroleum hub, and a civil nuclear deal.

Sri Lanka has sought to revitalize relations with the Western developed countries and institutions, which had deteriorated during the Rajapaksa government. The United States and the West could prove to be even more attractive economic partners as importers of Sri Lankan goods, suppliers of tourists, private investors, and government-to-government <a href="http://nation.lk/online/2015/06/13/htota-hub-under-review/">lenders</a>. These governments also wield the capacity to reduce the fiscal and political costs of <a href="http://www.sundaytimes.lk/150614/columns/gridlock-in-govt-is-lanka-being-micro-managed-from-afar-153192.html">post-conflict reconciliation</a>, and finance development initiatives. Both sides have made good faith efforts to repair relations. These include the deferral of UN human rights judgments and the initiation of democratic reforms, which U.S. Secretary of State Kerry praised during his visit to Sri Lanka in May--the highest diplomatic visit by a U.S. official in ten years. Sri Lanka has even positioned itself within Washington’s Indo-Pacific maritime security regime, committing to protecting the sea lanes and dispatching senior naval officers to visit the USS <em>Carl Vinson</em> (CVN 70).

Despite this rebalancing, Sri Lanka does not intend to alienate China. Sirisena’s March meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing made clear that Colombo <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-26/xi-moves-to-boost-china-sway-in-sri-lanka-to-counter-india-shift">values</a> a renewed economic relationship. Sri Lanka still needs <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-26/xi-moves-to-boost-china-sway-in-sri-lanka-to-counter-india-shift">capital</a>, but for more productive infrastructure than past projects, and China offers this with the <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-asia/sri-lanka-likely-to-have-access-to-asian-infrastructure-bank/article7036611.ece">Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank</a>. With China, Sri Lanka is also hoping to renegotiate the terms of its previous loans, sign a new free trade agreement, and cultivate tourism growth. If the Sri Lankan government does eventually approve the Port City under revised terms, this could prove a highly productive asset, while signaling that it offers a welcoming but rules-based investment climate. Sri Lanka’s defense relationship with China is also poised to expand beyond arms sales to more robust naval cooperation and potential observer status in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.

Sri Lanka still views Beijing as a critical partner, but hopes to prevent China from crowding out equally important strategic relationships with India, the U.S., Japan, and key international institutions. This likely rules out submarine port calls, as Sri Lanka’s foreign minister has made clear, or using Sri Lanka’s maritime infrastructure to project military power regardless of who leads the government. China may have learned similar lessons and begun making adjustments in its development partnership model. China has recently proposed a <a href="http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-04-01/news/60720105_1_trilateral-cooperation-indian-ocean-chinese-president-xi-jinping">trilateral dialogue</a> to allay Indian concerns over its presence in Sri Lanka, for example.

Chinese missteps have unwittingly provided opportunities for others. The United States, Japan, and Western-backed international financial institutions are revitalizing diplomatic and economic relationships, while India is beginning to reassert latent influence it always possessed and expand it with new strategic engagements. For its part, Sri Lanka has welcomed and cultivated renewed attention from great and emerging powers, but for the foreseeable future, it will actively balance these relationships to serve its broader interests.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Fair and Effective Code of Conduct for the South China Sea</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2002, ASEAN and China signed the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) that promised to “enhance favourable conditions for a peaceful and durable solution of differences and disputes among countries concerned.” Unfortunately, thirteen years on, the claimant countries are no closer to a solution for any of the disputes, while coercive and other unilateral acts are steadily accumulating into serious tensions. What is needed now is a Code of Conduct (COC) that not only overcomes the DOC’s weaknesses but also addresses the new challenges that have arisen since 2002.

The fact that China’s armed seizure of islands and reefs in 1974 and 1988 has not been repeated since 2002 could be seen as a success of the DOC. This might, however, also be due to the regional and global geopolitical environments. Furthermore, since 2009 China has developed the strategy of using paramilitary forces in white hulls against other claimants, including the use of water cannons, sabotaging seismic survey equipment, and vessel ramming-- all moves that seek to technically sidestep the DOC’s requirement that claimants not resort “to the threat of use of force.”

More fundamentally, the DOC has failed in that, except for the Sino-Vietnamese negotiation to demarcate the waters outside the Gulf of Tonkin, there has not been any negotiation to resolve the jurisdictional disputes, let alone the territorial ones.

The fact that since 2002 no country has inhabited previously uninhabited features is a clear success of the DOC. However, in 2012 China started to exclude Philippine nationals from Scarborough Reef, effectively seizing a previously uninhabited feature by using maritime paramilitary forces. Technically speaking, there is no inhabitation on the reef, so there is no violation of the DOC. On the other hand, the Declaration’s spirit of preventing the seizing of new features has been violated. In addition, China’s large scale island-building activities represent a massive change in the status of the features, even if they do not constitute new occupation. These actions thereby violate the spirit of the agreement. Last but not least, China’s blockade of Second Thomas Shoal is an attempt to dislodge the Philippines from a feature inhabited by its nationals, and is a violation of the complementary side of the same spirit.

With hindsight, we can date China’s abandonment of its “peaceful rise” policy to between 2006 and 2007 when it withdrew from UNCLOS’s dispute settlement procedure for matters relating to maritime delimitation and then pressed BP to pull out of petroleum projects in the Nam Con Son Basin. The Nam Con Son Basin is closer to Vietnam’s uncontested territories than to the disputed Spratlys, and UNCLOS’s dispute settlement procedure would no doubt lead to the conclusion that it is part of Vietnam’s EEZ. Ever since China’s withdrawal from UNCLOS dispute mechanisms, there has been a constant stream of incidents relating to maritime space that the DOC has been completely ineffectual in preventing. This failure stems from the fact that it fails to specify what “activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability” actually consist of. As a result, that phrase has become meaningless rhetoric that the claimants can brandish, sometimes hypocritically, to accuse others of violating the DOC.

Faced with mounting tensions caused by the strategies, tactics, and coercive and unilateral actions that have been deployed in the South China Sea since 2007, some governments and analysts have pinned hope on a new COC between ASEAN and China. However, the South China Sea region cannot afford another ineffectual document. The COC must not only overcome the DOC’s weaknesses but also address the new challenges that have arisen since 2002. Among these are the new strategies and tactics that various claimants have developed, China’s withdrawal from UNCLOS’s dispute settlement procedure for matters relating to maritime delimitation, and the newly created or enlarged islands in the Spratlys region. What, then, are the elements of a COC that may be fair and effective?

First, a COC should maintain the status quo regarding the various claimants’ de facto control over the islands and reefs. While each claimant naturally sees the others’ control over these features as illegal, any coercive attempt to change this status quo is unacceptable. These principles build on the DOC’s success in preventing the seizing of new features, taking into account new tactics such as seizing without inhabiting, dislodging an incumbent occupier by blockading, and large-scale island building. Hence:
<ol>
	<li><em>The claimants shall not seize features occupied by others; </em></li>
	<li><em>The claimants shall not blockade features occupied by others; </em></li>
	<li><em>The claimants shall not seize unoccupied features, either by actual occupation or by denying access to other claimants; </em></li>
	<li><em>The claimants shall not create artificial islands from submerged areas or low-tide elevations and shall not enlarge either natural or artificial islands; </em></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

A second set of principles must define the land features that are subject to sovereignty disputes, thereby deterring attempts to conjure up sovereignty or sovereignty disputes where none exists, or to deny the existence of actual disputes, all of which contribute significantly to tensions:
<ol start="5">
	<li><em>The claimants shall claim sovereignty only over islands, defined as features that are naturally above water at high tide. Low-tide elevations within the territorial sea of an island are under the same sovereignty as the island. The claimants shall come to an agreement on which features are islands, and which are not; </em></li>
	<li><em>The claimants shall come to an agreement on which islands are disputed among them; </em></li>
</ol>
<em> </em>

A third set of principles should address the islands’ 12 nautical mile territorial seas, over which the claimants claim sovereignty. Unlike the case with islands and reefs, there are no clear lines of control in these territorial seas, which means there is a high risk of clashes if any country justifies its unilateral actions there by saying that these actions are within its sovereignty. These principles aim to prevent coercive and other unfair unilateral actions in these territorial seas. They are also necessary for the protection of the rights of countries not involved in the disputes:
<ol start="7">
	<li><em>Claims to straight baselines and territorial sea shall conform to UNCLOS. The regime for the territorial sea, including the right of innocent passage, must conform to UNCLOS; </em></li>
	<li><em>The territorial sea of a disputed island is also disputed. The claimants shall agree on an equitable provisional regime for this disputed territorial sea; </em></li>
</ol>
<em> </em>

A fourth set of principles is required to reduce tensions in the waters of the South China Sea that are beyond the disputed islands and their territorial seas. While the tiny disputed islands are the basis of the conflicting claims in the South China Sea, it is the vast expanse of maritime space that is more valuable in terms of both resources and strategic control. Consequently, conflicts over jurisdictional rights over these waters are actually more likely than those over the islands themselves. It is worth noting that the concept of joint development of the disputed areas, which offers a promising approach for managing tensions, requires consensus on where these disputed areas are; these principles are necessary for that consensus.
<ol start="9">
	<li><em>The claimants shall come to an agreement on which disputed islands are entitled to EEZs; </em></li>
	<li><em>If an island is entitled to an EEZ, the claimants will come to an agreement on the extent of this EEZ, independent of questions over the island’s sovereignty; </em></li>
	<li><em>A disputed island’s EEZ is also disputed. The principles of UNCLOS Article 74 apply and the claimants will agree on a cooperative transitional regime based on these principles; </em></li>
</ol>
<em> </em>

Because different conduct is required for disputed areas and undisputed areas, the Code of Conduct must differentiate these two types of areas in order to be fair and effective. For example, a Code of Conduct might rightly stipulate joint development for the disputed areas, but that stipulation would be subverted if a claimant demanded that it be applied to areas that are not legally disputed:
<ol start="12">
	<li><em>The waters outside these EEZs have nothing to do with the sovereignty disputes over the islands and are therefore not disputed (unless they are disputed due to overlapping EEZ or continental shelf entitlements by the mainland coasts). In these undisputed waters, the parties to the COC shall come to concrete agreements for cooperation according to their rights and responsibilities under UNCLOS; </em></li>
</ol>
<em> </em>

Finally, not only must the terms of the COC be fair, but their interpretation must be objective, and the safety net for this is interpretation by an international court when all else fails:
<ol start="13">
	<li><em>If there are irreconcilable differences in any of the principles above or in their interpretation, an international court will arbitrate</em>.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

Unlike the DOC, the above principles do not address the resolution of the jurisdictional and territorial disputes. On the other hand, they lay out what is necessary for equitable and effective tension management in the South China Sea. Unfortunately, a claimant which judges that it could gain more through coercion is likely to regard equitable tension management as no more attractive than equitable solutions to the disputes. The other claimants must then decide: should they accept a COC that has been rendered ineffective so that all the relevant parties are willing to sign, or should they try to achieve COC with the necessary principles, but which one of the claimants will not sign? Perhaps the answer is that the smaller claimant countries should begin by agreeing among themselves the principles that are necessary for equitable tension management. They should then seek, and very likely receive, support for those principles from nations that abhor creeping coercion and aim to ensure fairness and stability. This will both help to improve the chance of achieving a more effective COC and give them additional protection where this COC still has limitations.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>China May Lose Friends in Southeast Asia</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Several Southeast Asian countries have expressed concern over Beijing’s belligerent behavior and aggressive posturing in the South China Sea. A litany of complaints of harassment of innocent fishermen by Chinese Coast Guard vessels has been reported by Vietnam and the Philippines, who are visibly angry with China. These incidents have led to stand-offs between maritime security forces, shadowing and buzzing by aircraft, including obstruction of exploration ships and rigs. Issues such as freedom of navigation and the possibility of China announcing an ADIZ over the South China Sea have also unnerved regional countries. If these trends continue, these could potentially result in deterioration of relations between China and the Southeast Asian countries and Beijing may soon lose friends.

In light of these developments, the ongoing standoff between Malaysia and China over the presence of a Chinese coast guard ship Haijing (CCG-1123) anchored in Malaysia’s Economic Zone (EEZ) merits attention. Following the sighting of the Chinese coast guard ship off Luconia Shoals (<a href="http://www.angmalaya.net/nation/2015/06/09/11293-malaysia-sends-royal-navy-maritime-enforcers-to-guard-territory-against-china-taking-diplomatic-actions">Beting Patinggi Ali</a> in Malay) nearly 90 nautical miles north of Sarawak, the Malaysian government ordered the navy and the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) to deploy ships and aircraft and monitor the activities of the Chinese ship. The Malaysian Navy chief Abdul Aziz Jaafar expressed concern over the intrusion by the Chinese ship and announced that his forces were continuously <a href="http://www.nationmultimedia.com/aec/Malaysia-to-protest-over-China-Coast-Guard-intrusi-30261929.html">monitoring and shadowing</a> the Chinese vessel. Further, since September 2014, intrusion by Chinese vessels in Malaysian waters had increased and “<a href="http://www.nationmultimedia.com/aec/Malaysia-to-protest-over-China-Coast-Guard-intrusi-30261929.html">We protest every time. We see them every day</a>.” Jaafar was also disappointed that there was no response from the Chinese ship when it was contacted by radio with warnings to leave Malaysian waters using international distress and <a href="http://www.nationmultimedia.com/aec/Malaysia-to-protest-over-China-Coast-Guard-intrusi-30261929.html">calling frequencies</a>. Malaysian National Security Minister Shahidan Kassim stated that Luconia Shoals fall in the Malaysian EEZ and warned that Prime Minister Najib Razak <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/09/southchinasea-malaysia-china-idUSL3N0YV07A20150609">would raise the issue directly</a> with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

There is a history of Chinese Coast Guard ships intruding into the waters of other claimants in the South China Sea. The Philippines has accused China of harassing its fishermen by firing water cannons at them and, in a recent case, ramming into boats. In 2014, in a television interview, Philippines President Benigno Aquino stated that two Chinese hydrographic survey ships were sighted in the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/18/us-philippines-southchinasea-idUSKBN0GI0EK20140818">Recto Bank</a>, about 80 nautical miles off Palawan, within the Philippines claimed EEZ.  Aquino also made known that Chinese Coast Guard ships were often spotted patrolling around <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/18/us-philippines-southchinasea-idUSKBN0GI0EK20140818">Second Thomas Shoal</a>. Also, in May 2014, two Chinese survey vessels were sighted in Galoc, an oil field in western Palawan. Earlier this year, the Philippines government lodged strong protest with China over an incident involving a Chinese Coast Guard ship which <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/04/us-philippines-china-idUSKBN0L81IM20150204">rammed three Philippine fishing boats</a> in the disputed Scarborough Shoal area.

Vietnam has also been at the receiving end of disruptive Chinese activities in the South China Sea. The Chinese Coast Guard conducted aggressive maneuvers including ramming and a 2014 video of Chinese ships firing water cannons at a Vietnamese vessel was made public. Interestingly, water cannons were also used against a Vietnamese law enforcement vessels and a Chinese aircraft flew over Vietnamese police patrol boats in a bid to threaten them.

At another level, Chinese fishermen engage in illegal fishing and Greenpeace reported that Chinese boats were seen as far as west coast of Africa <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/21/us-china-fishing-africa-idUSKBN0O60E720150521">illegally fishing in big numbers</a>. In May 2015, the Indonesian government ordered the sinking of 41 boats including a 300-ton Chinese fishing vessel Gui Xei Yu that was caught illegally fishing in its waters in 2009. Apparently, Chinese fishermen were not deterred by the above incident and soon after that Chinese fishing vessels were <a href="http://www.republika.co.id/berita/en/national-politics/15/05/28/np19q0-chinese-ships-still-spotted-poaching-in-indonesian-waters">spotted poaching</a> in Makassar Strait and Tomini Bay. The Indonesian Traditional Fishermen Association (KNTI) observed that Chinese registered fishing boats, identified by the <a href="http://www.republika.co.id/berita/en/national-politics/15/05/28/np19q0-chinese-ships-still-spotted-poaching-in-indonesian-waters">nine-digit</a> Maritime Mobile Service Identity codes, are often seen in Indonesian waters.

As far as Malaysia is concerned, the presence of Chinese Coast Guard vessels may potentially encourage it to respond aggressively by posturing and deploying military assets, which may in turn bring the two maritime forces close enough to cause a naval incident. Malaysia has preferred ‘quiet diplomacy’ to prevent any escalation in its relationship with China. In 2013, it was reported that Chinese naval and maritime surveillance forces had made incursions in <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2013/11/china-and-malaysia-to-hold-maritime-exercises-what-gives/">waters off East Malaysia, </a>which were not publicized at the time. Further, Malaysia has worked to prevent the sort of anti-China nationalist sentiments were seen in Hanoi in 2014.

Beijing’s reclamation and construction activities on the islands /reefs in the South China Sea also have not gone unnoticed in Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur, however, has chosen to remain quiet given that it too has undertaken reclamation on some of the features under its control from where it has attempted to project <a href="http://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/051315_Shear_Testimony.pdf">civilian or maritime presence</a> into surrounding waters.

It is fair to say that if China does not order its ship to leave Malaysian waters, it may result in a diplomatic standoff with adverse repercussions. This may in turn result in a soured relationship and fading of the ‘charm offensive’ that has been very cleverly employed by China through a number of economic engagements with the Southeast Asian countries. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), a Chinese initiative to finance infrastructure construction in the continent, may run into serious jeopardy if China does not stop its provocative behavior in the South China Sea. Likewise, Southeast Asian countries may shy away from the Chinese 21<sup>st</sup> century Maritime Silk Road (MSR) which could be a major setback for the Chinese leadership,  which sees Southeast Asia as a springboard to launch the initiative.

In essence, the current standoff in the Luconia Shoals creates the potential that Beijing may lose a much-needed friend. Malaysia is currently holding the Chairmanship of the ASEAN, and its position on these issues may in turn have influence Vietnam and the Philippines’ stance towards Chinese behavior.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Philippine Navy and Japan’s Maritime Self Defense Forces in the South China Sea</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For the first time since the Second World War, a Japanese naval reconnaissance plane landed on the western most Philippine island of Palawan to take part in a training exercise with the Philippine Navy (PN) from June 22 to June 26. On June 21, a Maritime Self-Defense Force (MDSF) P3-C Orion with 20 crew members from Kanoya Air Base in Kagoshima Prefecture arrived in the Philippines to take part in a training exercise that showed the increasing tempo of Philippine-Japan maritime security cooperation.   According to the PN press release, the training activity focused on developing the fleet skills and the interoperability of the two countries’ navies in Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response (HA/DR) operations, particularly on search and rescue of stricken vessels or downed aircraft in the high seas.  It involved one fixed wing maritime aircraft from the two navies and a PN patrol vessel. The exercise was conducted on the high seas, approximately140 kilometers northwest of Palawan.  Officials from both countries emphasized that the training activity was primarily a disaster-relief and search-and rescue exercise, not a reconnaissance operation. Both sides acknowledged that this joint exercise also aimed to foster camaraderie and to strengthen the budding PN- MSDF maritime security partnership.

On the first day of the exercise, the MSDF P3-C Orion, with three Filipino crew members on board, flew over the edge of the Reed Bank. The Japanese reconnaissance aircraft,   accompanied by a smaller PN Islander patrol plane, practiced search and rescue patterns, which are essential in any humanitarian assistance and rescue response.  The following day, the two aircrafts conducted another search and rescue operation drill 93 kilometers northwest of Palawan, again near Reed Bank.  MSDF Commander Hiromo Hamano described the exercise as a success and proposed that HADR/SAR training between the MSDF and PN be continued. This is the second MSDF-PN joint training exercise this season.  The first was held on May 12 when two MSDF destroyers and a PN frigate held a drill on the Code for Unplanned Encounter at Sea (CUES) near Subic Bay in Luzon.

<strong>            </strong>In the aftermath of the PN-MSDF joint training, Philippine Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin acknowledged an increasing convergence of security concerns between the Philippines and Japan as he called for the need for a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) between the two countries. His statement echoed President Benigno Aquino’s earlier announcement that the Philippines is ready to start talks with Japan for a SOFA that would allow Self Defense Forces’ (SDF) ships and planes to refuel in the Philippines and to hold joint exercise with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).  Secretary Gazmin also stated that the two countries have commenced discussions for an agreement that will provide for the transfer of Japanese defense equipment and technology to the Philippines. Japanese government sources revealed that that a P3-C Orion reconnaissance aircraft and radar related equipment are being considered for transfer to the AFP.

This joint PN-MSDF maritime activity is part of a broader effort by the Philippines and Japan to boost their strategic partnership in the face of China’s naval expansion in the South China Sea.  Both sides claimed that the activity is aimed at developing the PN’s and MSDF’s fleet skills and interoperability in conducting HA/DR operations in the high seas. However, the activity also demonstrated a future plausible scenario in which the SDF can conduct long-range patrols alone or in concert with the PN or the U.S. Navy in the South China Sea.  Given access to Philippine bases for its refueling and maintenance needs, MSDF air and naval units can operate for a longer time and over a wider area of the South China Sea.  Such activity is envisioned by the June 4, 2015 Japan-Philippine Joint Declaration that emphasizes the importance of security cooperation between the Philippines and Japan, and other allies in the region, “at a time when the security environment in the region is faced with many challenges.”

For Manila, a strategic partnership with Tokyo is part of its comprehensive efforts to avoid becoming economically dependent on Beijing.  Unlike most Southeast Asian countries  that have China as their number one trading partner and Official Development Assistance (ODA) donor, the Philippines has Japan as its most important trading partner and ODA donor.   For Tokyo, on the other hand, a security relationship with Manila converges with Washington’s efforts to revitalize its alliance as the Philippines bears the brunt of China’s assertiveness in the South China Sea.  The development of a Philippine-Japan strategic partnership is part of a trend developing among U.S. allies and security partners in the region in the face of China’s growing naval power.  These partners regard American strategic presence as the best guarantee of peace and security in East Asia; however, they also see the urgency to establish and foster security relationships among themselves to amplify the stabilizing effects of U.S. forward-deployed presence and alliances in the region.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As far as China’s designs in the South China Sea are concerned, there is little sign of compromise on the horizon.  Not only has China openly declared its commitment <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/06/03/the-two-words-that-explain-chinas-naval-strategy-active-defense/">to “active defense”</a> of its interests in adjacent waters, and also <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/01/world/asia/china-says-it-could-set-up-air-defense-zone-in-south-china-sea.html">dangled the option</a> of imposing an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the area, but also it is now <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/china/2015-06/16/content_35832652.htm">only few steps away</a> from concluding its massive construction activities in the Spratly chain of Islands.

Meanwhile, the Pentagon is assessing its strategic options and weighing the wisdom of extending its surveillance operations into the 12 nautical miles territorial sea of Chinese-constructed islands in the South China Sea. The Obama administration, confronting stiff legislative opposition at home, is struggling to expedite the conclusion of the Transpacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. In response, Singapore, a key TPP partner, <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/shanmugam-promotes-trans/1918426.html">has openly questioned</a> Washington commitment to the region.

Intent on checking China’s territorial assertiveness, however, the United States’ allies and regional partners have been strengthening their partnership against Beijing. While an energized Japan, under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, is <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/made-beijing-anti-china-alliance-emerges-13104">carving out a</a> new regional security role, the Philippines and Vietnam have progressively <a href="http://verafiles.org/ph-vietnam-to-hold-naval-drills-scientific-research-in-south-china-sea/">pursued a full-fledged strategic partnership</a> to protect their common interests in the South China Sea. The smaller powers are displaying remarkable strategic initiative.

<strong>Breaking Barriers </strong>

Throughout the Cold War period, Manila and Hanoi were on the opposite sides of the great ideological divide, as Washington and Moscow directed their regional proxies against each other. The two Southeast Asian countries also competed over disputed features in the South China Sea, particularly in the Spratly chain of islands, where Vietnam would come control the most number of features and the Philippines managed to establish the first airstrip, on Thitu (<em>Pag-Asa</em>) Island.

After the end of Cold War, the Philippines, specifically under the Ramos administration (1992-1998), welcomed the admission of Vietnam into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Adhering to the principle of “constructive engagement”, Filipino policymakers believed that Vietnam’s integration into the regional order would facilitate its transformation into a force for stability and peace in East Asia.

China’s coercive occupation of the Philippine-claimed Mischief Reef in 1994 also underlined the importance of developing strong ties with fellow claimant states in the ASEAN. Together with Vietnam, the Philippines pushed for regional unity amid Chinese territorial opportunism, culminating in the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC). In the following years, the Philippines and Vietnam negotiated a trilateral <a href="http://verafiles.org/ph-vietnam-to-hold-naval-drills-scientific-research-in-south-china-sea/">Joint Maritime Seismic Undertaking (JMSU)</a> agreement with China, hoping to collectively tame China’s ambitions under a joint development scheme.

By 2010, Vietnam and the Philippines, using their leadership roles in the ASEAN and ASEAN-U.S. Leaders Meeting, jointly pushed for more robust American intervention against China, which stepped up its paramilitary patrols and formally declared its notorious Nine-Dashed Line claims across the South China Sea. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/29/AR2010072906416.html">In response</a>, the Obama administration explicitly identified freedom of navigation in international waters as a “national interest” priority.

With much of the ASEAN <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/03/is-asean-still-relevant/">reluctant to stand up</a> to China, the Philippines and Vietnam emerged as the most hawkish and vocal critics of Beijing in regional fora. Recognizing ASEAN’s internal divisions and bureaucratic lethargy in pushing for a Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea, the two countries pushed for ASEAN <em>minilateralism</em>, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/03/south-china-sea-disputes-gloves-201431152920241884.html">hoping to gather the support</a> of fellow Southeast claimant states, namely Malaysia and Brunei, against China.

<strong>Full-fledged Partnership </strong>

While Brunei, eager to avoid conflict with bigger neighbors, has effectively abandoned its claims in the South China Sea, Malaysia has <a href="http://www.cnas.org/sites/default/files/publications-pdf/CNAS%20Maritime%206_Parameswaran_Final.pdf">been extremely cautious</a> (if not coy) vis-à-vis its territorial disputes with China, refusing to antagonize its key trading partner. Left with limited support from fellow ASEAN countries, Hanoi and Manila have reached out to sympathetic external powers, particularly the United States and Japan, as well as each other.

They have both welcomed greater American military footprint in Asia, while embracing Japan as a potential counterbalance to China. Both Obama and Abe administrations <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/SEA-03-181213.html">have stepped up</a> their assistance to Hanoi and Manila, particularly in terms of improving their domain awareness and minimum deterrence capability. Recently, Japan has considered <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/japan-discuss-military-exports-philippines-31517058">the potential export of</a> P-3C anti-submarine reconnaissance aircraft and radar technology to the Philippines, which, in return, is <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/philippines/11653747/Philippines-to-allow-Japan-to-use-its-military-bases-against-Chinese-aggression.html">considering granting</a> Japanese troops access to its military bases close to the South China Sea.

The Obama administration, however, <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-philippines-china-us-triangle-precarious-relationship-10342">is yet to provide</a> an explicit guarantee of military support in an event of conflict between its Filipino ally and China over disputed features in the South China Sea. The Abe administration, meanwhile, will have to overcome considerable domestic and regional opposition if it is to successfully recast Japan’s pacifist restrictions on overseas military operations and, under the principle of “<a href="http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2014/06/20/why-abe-is-pushing-for-the-right-to-collective-self-defence/">collective self-defense</a>” expand the Japanese Self Defense Forces’ perimeter of operation.

As the two frontline states, Vietnam and the Philippines have drafted a “Joint Statement on the Establishment of a Strategic Partnership between the Republic of the Philippines and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.” According to some diplomatic sources, the agreement will be signed next year alongside a similar agreement with another ASEAN country in order to downplay perceptions of an outright Philippine-Vietnam alliance against China. Under the proposed agreement, the <a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/04/23/1447093/phl-vietnam-hold-naval-drills-scientific-research-south-china-sea">two countries are expected to engage</a> in institutionalized high-level bilateral dialogue; coordinate their diplomatic language and maneuver in regional and international fora; and regularly conduct joint naval, coast guard exercises, and scientific research in the South China Sea.

The two countries have also regularly exchanged views on the utility of international legal arbitration to bring China to the negotiating table. During his mid-2014 visit to Manila, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung openly <a href="http://www.shanghaidaily.com/article/article_xinhua.aspx?id=219649">sought Manila’s legal advice</a> on a potential lawsuit against Beijing, under the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea. <a href="http://cogitasia.com/the-tragedy-of-small-power-politics-vietnam-the-philippines-and-the-great-powers/">Given Vietnam’s</a> geographical proximity to and economic dependence on China, not to mention the country’s strong party-to-party ties, it has had to tread more cautiously than the Philippines, which enjoys a treaty alliance with Washington. Nevertheless, what’s clear is that despite their age-old rivalry in the Spratlys, Manila and Hanoi have been bound by a common threat in China.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Chinese authorities, as well as sympathetic writers, have in recent months sought to deflect criticism of China’s island-building campaign in the Spratlys by insisting that Beijing is merely copying what other claimants have done for years. According to this narrative, every claimant is as guilty as Beijing of altering the status of features in the South China Sea in contravention of international law and escalating tensions. But this narrative is false. Unfortunately, in one recent case, poorly chosen messaging from Washington has only strengthened it.

China’s argument against the Philippines is the easiest to dismiss. No evidence has been offered to show that Manila has engaged in large-scale dredging or reclamation work, other than the expansion of a narrow strip of sand off Thitu Island years ago to allow for the construction of a runway. The Philippines has engaged in some reclamation to prevent erosion at features, just as all claimants have (and just as occurs at coastal and island beaches around the world). Most importantly, Manila has never attempted to create a rock or island from a low-tide elevation, as China has at three of the seven features it occupies. That is by far the most legally troubling, and most provocative of China’s actions.

Malaysia also engaged in reclamation work at Swallow Reef, on which it built an airstrip, luxury scuba diving resort, and small naval base in the 1980s. The natural rock or island was expanded from approximately <a href="http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20150210000053&amp;cid=1101">25 acres to 85 acres</a>. That is admittedly substantial, but a drop in the bucket compared to the thousands of acres built by China in the last two years. And, as with Thitu Island, it is important to recognize that Malaysia construction did not seek to alter either the geographic or legal status of Swallow Reef.

Among the claimants, Vietnam presents the most tempting target for the disinformation campaign. It occupies the most features, much of that occupation is not well-documented, and the government in Hanoi has traditionally been more reticent than Manila to disclose details of its activities in the Spratlys. Worse, it clearly has engaged in reclamation work on some of its features, most obviously <a href="http://amti.csis.org/sand-cay-tracker/">Sand Cay</a> and <a href="http://amti.csis.org/west-reef-tracker/">West (London) Reef</a>, though again, at a tiny fraction of the scale pursued by China. According to unverified Chinese sources, it has also done reclamation at <a href="http://slide.mil.news.sina.com.cn/h/slide_8_31042_35906.html#p=7">Central (London) Reef</a>, <a href="http://slide.mil.news.sina.com.cn/h/slide_8_31042_35906.html#p=9">Grierson Reef</a>, <a href="http://slide.mil.news.sina.com.cn/h/slide_8_31042_35906.html#p=10">Namyit Island</a>, <a href="http://slide.mil.news.sina.com.cn/h/slide_8_31042_35906.html#p=6">Pearson Reef</a>, <a href="http://slide.mil.news.sina.com.cn/h/slide_8_31042_35906.html#p=12">Sin Cowe Island</a>, and <a href="http://slide.mil.news.sina.com.cn/h/slide_8_31042_35906.html#p=5">Southwest Cay</a>.

In many of these cases, Vietnam clearly engaged in reclamation <em>after</em> the signing of the 2002 Declaration of Conduct for Parties in the South China Sea, thereby undercutting some (but not all) of its moral authority in saying China’s island building violates the spirit of the agreement. This is not helpful, and is precisely why Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter has called on all parties to refrain from further reclamation and construction, and did so during his meeting in Hanoi with Defense Minister Phung Quang Thanh. But again, key differences must be pointed out—Hanoi’s reclamation work has been a drop in the bucket compared to Beijing’s, and to date, there has been no documentation of Vietnam reclaiming a low-tide elevation or submerged feature to turn it into a rock or island. In other words, like the Philippines and Malaysia, Vietnam has engaged in reclamation or expansion, but not outright island building as China has.

Of late, the U.S. government has contributed to this muddying of the waters. While <a href="http://www.foreign.senate.gov/hearings/safeguarding-american-interests-in-the-east-and-south-china-seas">testifying</a> before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on May 13, Assistant Secretary of Defense David Shear noted that “Vietnam has 48 outposts; the Philippines, 8; China, 8; Malaysia, 5, and Taiwan, 1.” The fact that Vietnam had “48 outposts” was news to those who closely follow the South China Sea, both in the United States and in the region. In fact, it was more than twice what most experts cite as the number of features occupied by Vietnam. Many assumed Shear had misspoken, but then Secretary Carter repeated the figure in <a href="http://www.defense.gov/Speeches/Speech.aspx?SpeechID=1945">his speech</a> at the Shangri-La Dialogue.

It didn’t take long for casual South China Sea watchers, and those more sympathetic to China’s position, to jump on the 48 figure as evidence that Vietnam has been the real aggressor. In the Diplomat, <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/06/who-is-the-biggest-aggressor-in-the-south-china-sea/">Greg Austin asserted</a> that Vietnam has doubled the number of features it had occupied since 1996. What this and similar arguments overlooked is that Shear and Carter did not say that Vietnam occupies 48 features, they said that it has 48 “outposts.” For some reason, Washington decided to individually count every visible structure Vietnam has built on low-tide elevations and other features—something it never did for Chinese-occupied features before the island building campaign.

This means the U.S. government is counting Great Discovery Reef, for example, three times because Vietnam has built <a href="http://slide.mil.news.sina.com.cn/h/slide_8_31042_35906.html#p=19">three different “pillbox” structures</a> at different locations around the reef. Combined, those structures cover approximately 3.5 acres, with the two farthest from each other separated by about 5 nautical miles, and the two closest by less than 1 nautical mile. By comparison, China’s work at Fiery Cross Reef stretches about 2 nautical miles from end to end and covers 800 acres, with numerous facilities. Not only is this method of accounting for occupation in the Spratlys extremely misleading, but by not explaining its methods, Washington has helped fuel China’s false narrative.

If the long game for the Southeast Asian claimants, the United States, and like-minded nations is to rally international opprobrium against China in the hopes that Beijing will recognize the costs of its extralegal claims, then messaging that plays into China’s narrative of victimization is a sure way to lose.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Post-Hearing Reality in the South China Sea Arbitration Case</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Hague hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility of the South China Sea arbitration case has come to an end on July 13 after a weeklong process without China’s participation. The hearing has become a heated headline for medias, governments, and scholars for the past week. Questions include whether the Arbitral Tribunal will issue a decision on the jurisdiction and admissibility on July 13, who the decision might favor, to what extend the Tribunal may render its jurisdiction, if there is any, the reaction of China and the Philippines might be, and what might be the take-away for countries who sent observers to the hearing, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Japan.

China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman has reiterated China’s position of “no accepting and no participating” in The Hague process, and accused as usual the Philippines’ of violating its commitment through the 2002 Declaration on Conduct (DoC) to solve the dispute through negotiations. Most traditional Chinese media stories repeated Chinese government’ position through various forms of interviews. Social media such as <em>Weibo</em> and <em>Wechat</em> invited discussions and debates among young people whose interests range widely from symbolic nationalism to geopolitics and security. Scholars of international law support China’s position by elaborating on the December 7, 2014 Position Paper of the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Matter of Jurisdiction in the South China Sea Arbitration, arguing that the Tribunal manifestly has no jurisdiction.

Despite the overwhelming support in China of its position, experts and the general public also have concerns. First, the case presented by the Philippines constitutes, at its core, a land territorial sovereignty dispute and the relevant maritime delimitation, which is excluded from the third party compulsory dispute settlement mechanism under UNCLOS, through China’s 2006 declaration. However, the way the Philippines presented its claim-- it has cleverly attempted to de-link its claims from the terms of “territory,” “maritime delimitation,” and “historic title,” with the support of the experienced legal team from the United States-- might have a substantial impact on the Arbitration Tribunal. China, may in turn, miss the chance to express its position in a professional legal way, as it did through the December 7, 2014 position paper. It is also questionable whether the messages that China intends to convey through <em>amicus curiae</em> (“friends of the court”) publications reach the five arbitrators and how much weight these may carry as effective “replies” to the Memorial of the Philippines.

In addition to the specifics of the legal debate, China’s international image is another key issue that is worrisome to many. The international media has been skewed in its writing about the escalation of the South China Sea disputes, and often depicts China’s growing assertiveness in pursing its maritime claims. China’s refusal to participate in the Arbitration is often cited by media as disrespecting the value of international law, despite Beijing’s efforts to convince itself and the world that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction.

The interests shown in the hearing by other countries, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Japan also send signals to China as it considered possible future international litigation or arbitration of the complex territorial and maritime dispute in this region. The decision by the Tribunal, be it “no jurisdiction,” “partial jurisdiction,” or “full jurisdiction” on the Philippines’ claim, will allow other countries in the region to draw conclusions about the possibility of resorting to a third party forum for maritime dispute settlement. The position taken by China in this legal battle with the Philippines might not be a standard solution that works best for it if additional cases are brought in the future.

The Statement on the South China Sea issued by the Taiwan authority on July 7, 2015, is a timely response to the hearing at The Hague. In addition to reiterating the  ROC’s position on its sovereignty claim over the four archipelago groups in the South China Sea, the statement focuses mainly on the legal nature of Taiping Island (Itu Aba), the biggest naturally formed feature in the Spratlys. Taiwan holds that Taiping Island indisputably qualifies as an “island” according to Article 121 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea （UNCLOS), and can sustain human habitation and economic life of its own. Taipei’s statement that “[a]ny claims by other countries which aim to deny this fact will not impair the legal status of Taiping Island (Itu Aba) and its maritime rights based on UNCLOS,” is obviously a firm response to the claims by the Philippines’ legal team that deems Ita Aba a “rock.” Though there has been no official comment from Beijing on Taipei’s statement, which implies that the two governments across the strait share the same claim in the South China Sea, the declaration has defused China’s concerns that the Taiwan government might change its position on the South China Sea due to pressures from the United States. Interestingly, the Taipei’s statement did not mention the U-shaped Line, which is also a major part of the Philippines’ case. Whether this is a signal that the Taiwan government may abandon this line or deliberately overlook it remains a question, and one that will be especially salient following the “presidential campaign” in Taiwan in 2016.

There are two possible scenarios after the hearing. No matter which party wins the case, the award will be legally ineffective for resolving the disputes presented. If China loses the case, its claims will remain the same and its preference for solving the South China dispute through negotiations will not change. If the Philippines loses the case, it can be expected to drop this particular legal case against China. But it will not drop its objections altogether, due to the unresolved core territorial and maritime disputes between these two states. These will still need to be addressed between the two governments through negotiation.

The Philippines has been widely praised for setting the precedent of resorting to  a third-party compulsory settlement mechanism to deal with the multiple overlapping claims in the South China Sea, and the value of the compulsory dispute settlement mechanism provided by UNLCOS should not be underestimated. The impact of the arbitration case on regional security, however, should also not be overlooked, given the complex nature of the disputes involving both sovereignty and maritime delimitation. In the short term, the arbitration case has increased tensions in the South China Sea and has delayed both cooperation and progress towards an agreed Code of Conduct. In the longer term, it may clarify some legal issues, but this comes at the risk of undermining the international dispute settlement process. The South China Sea arbitration case has proven to be a typical example of a political game of international law.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On December 8, 2014, the Chinese Embassy in the Netherlands deposited with the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA), the Registry for the South China Sea arbitral proceedings, a <em>Note Verbale. </em>The PCA was asked to forward <em>the Position Paper of the Government of the People’s Republic of China on the Matters of Jurisdiction in the South China Sea Arbitration Initiated by the Republic of the Philippines</em><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> and its English translation to the five members of the Arbitral Tribunal that was constituted under Annex VII to UNCLOS. On December 11, 2014, the PCA conveyed to the Parties that it had received and forwarded to the members of the Tribunal copies of the <em>Note Verbale</em> from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and accompanying Position Paper. On December 16, 2014, the Parties to the case were invited to comment on a possible bifurcation of the proceedings, with a view to addressing some or all issues of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction as a preliminary matter.

The 2014 Chinese position paper argues that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the case because: (1) the essence of the subject matter of the arbitration is the territorial sovereignty over several maritime features in the South China Sea, which is beyond the scope of UNCLOS and does not concern the interpretation or application of the Convention; (2) PRC and the Philippines have agreed, through bilateral instruments and the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, to settle their relevant disputes through negotiations. By unilaterally initiating the present arbitration, the Philippines has breached its obligation under international law; and (3) even assuming, <em>arguendo</em>, that the subject matter of the arbitration were concerned with the interpretation or application of the Convention, that subject-matter would constitute an integral part of maritime delimitation between the two countries, thus falling within the scope of the declaration filed by PRC in August 2006 in accordance with UNCLOS, which excludes, <em>inter alia</em>, disputes concerning maritime delimitation from compulsory arbitration and other compulsory dispute settlement procedures.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>

Although PRC reiterates that it will neither accept nor participate in the arbitration unilaterally initiated by the Philippines, the Tribunal considered the Chinese position paper as an objection to its jurisdiction over the case. Under Article 20, paragraph 1, of the Rule of Procedure<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> that was adopted by the Tribunal on August 27, 2013, the Tribunal should have power to rule on objections to its jurisdiction. In accordance with paragraph 3 of the same article, the Tribunal should rule on any plea concerning its jurisdiction as a preliminary question. For reasons set out in Procedural Order No. 4 issued on April 21, 2015, the Tribunal considered the Chinese communications constitute, in effect, a plea that the Philippines’ submissions fall outside the scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. As such, the Tribunal decided to bifurcate the proceedings in this case and to limit this month’s Hague hearings to the issue of jurisdiction.

The Tribunal decided not to open the July 2015 hearings to the public. However, after receiving written requests from interested states, the Tribunal permitted the governments of Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam to send small observer delegations.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> On July 13, 2015, the Tribunal concluded the hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility. By July 23, the Philippines will submit further written responses to the questions posed by the Tribunal during the hearing. The Tribunal also decided to provide PRC with the opportunity to comment in writing, by August 17, 2015, on anything said during the hearings on jurisdiction and admissibility that were held at The Hague. Paul Reichler, a counsel to the Philippines, expects a decision on jurisdiction to be handed down by the Tribunal within 90 days after the hearings.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> He also said that a final Tribunal award could take years.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>

Taiwan, a party to the sovereignty and maritime disputes in the South China Sea, has kept a close watch on the development of the arbitration case. Taking note of Articles 3 and 13 of Annex VII to the UNCLOS, the government of Taiwan once considered the possibility of intervention in the case as a third party. This policy option was ruled out because of Taiwan’s unique and complicated political status. Taiwan’s interest in intervention in the case was also impeded by the fact that it is not a party to the Convention.

Taiwan was keen to send representatives to observe the hearings held at The Hague this week. Unfortunately due to the sensitive political and sovereignty issues involved, Taiwan’s request to send a delegation was not granted by the Tribunal. It is very likely that the governments of both the Philippines and the PRC advised the Tribunal not to accept Taiwan’s request because of their respective political considerations -- in particular the rigid adherence by both governments to the “One China” policy.

In his July 7 speech at an international conference in Taipei commemorating the 70th anniversary of the ROC victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, ROC President Ma Ying-jeou stated that the ROC government will “staunchly defend” its sovereignty over Taiping Island in the South China Sea, consistent with international law. In addition, he said, “In the future, the ROC government will continue development on Taiping [Itu Aba Island] with the aim of peace, to make it a hub for humanitarian assistance, environmental protection and scientific research in the Spratly Islands.” President Ma also stressed that Taiping Island meets the definition of an island under international law. Any attempt by other countries to deny Taiping its status as an island will not undermine its legal standing, he said.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> Clearly these statements were made in response to the ongoing arbitral proceedings at The Hague. In particular, Taiwan is concerned about the Philippines’ claim in its case that Taiping is not an island but a rock under Article 121 of UNCLOS.

Also on July 7, the ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an eight point statement on the South China Sea,<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> which again demonstrates Taiwan’s concern about a possible negative outcome of the Philippines v. PRC arbitral case concerning the legal status of Taiping Island. Point Three of the Statement stresses that Taiping Island “indisputably qualifies” as an “island” under Article 121 of UNCLOS. It is also emphasizes that the ROC government “will firmly defend this fact.” The Ministry makes it clear that “[a]ny claims by other countries which aim to deny this fact will not impair the legal status of Taiping Island . . . and its maritime rights based on UNCLOS.” Point Eight of the statement provides that “[a]ny arrangement or agreement regarding Taiping Island . . . or other islands in the South China Sea and their surrounding waters that is reached without ROC participation and consent shall have no legal effect on the ROC and shall not be recognized by the ROC government.”

Taiping Island has been claimed by the ROC government since December 1946 and ROC troops have been garrisoned there since 1956. Taipei hopes to convince the members of the Tribunal that the land feature is not a rock, as argued by the Philippines in its Memorial, but an island under the Convention and therefore has the right to generate a 200 nautical mile EEZ and continental shelf. As far as the U-Shaped Line claim is concerned, Taiwan is not yet ready to clarify its legal meaning under international law—hence, its absence from the July 7 statement.

In order to demonstrate to the international community and to the Tribunal that Taiping has been under Taiwan’s effective control since 1956, that it is capable of sustaining human habitation and an economic life of its own, and that it is therefore is an island but not a rock in accordance with Article 121, it is likely that President Ma will visit Taiping Island before the end of 2015. It is also possible that he may announce a roadmap to implement the South China Sea Peace Initiative (SCSPI) that he proposed on May 26 of this year in Taipei. As far as the primary submission of the Philippines in the arbitral case is concerned, that is, that China’s Nine-Dash Line and historic rights claims are contrary to the Convention, Taiwan is adopting a delaying strategy. President Ma will not rush to clarify the legal meaning of Taiwan’s U-Shaped Line before he leaves office in 2016.

		<title>What Makes an Island? Land Reclamation and the South China Sea Arbitration</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have all heard about <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-expands-island-construction-in-disputed-south-china-sea-1424290852">land reclamation</a> by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in the South China Sea, particularly the southeastern region known as the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/05/31/world/asia/Territorial-Claims-in-South-China-Sea.html">Spratly Group</a>. But much less is being said about what the Permanent Court of Arbitration just <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-33421599">finished considering</a> for the past week: are artificial islands really islands? According to the Philippines, the answer is straightforward: No. In its initial <a href="http://www.dfa.gov.ph/newsroom/unclos">statement of claim</a>, the Philippines asked the Court to invalidate China’s Nine-Dash Line (click <a href="http://amti.csis.org/arbitration-101-philippines-v-china/">here</a> for a good overview of that issue) and determine that eight PRC-controlled maritime features are not islands. Of these eight features, seven are home to ongoing PRC <a href="http://amti.csis.org/diplomacy-changes-construction-continues-new-images-of-mischief-and-subi-reefs/">land reclamation</a>.

The Philippines has a strong case for why the PRC’s artificial islands should not be considered real islands. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and past decisions by international tribunals suggest that land reclamation will not affect the Permanent Court of Arbitration’s decision because: (1) artificial islands don’t have the legal significance afforded natural islands, and; (2) land reclamation occurred after the so-called “critical date” when the China-Philippines dispute “crystallized” in international legal terms.

<strong><em>Why This Matters</em></strong>

<em> </em>Recent land reclamation has dramatically transformed seven disputed maritime features in the Spratly Islands. These include <a href="http://amti.csis.org/mischief-reef-tracker/">Mischief</a>, <a href="http://amti.csis.org/gaven-reef-tracker/">Gaven</a>, <a href="http://amti.csis.org/subi-reef-tracker/">Subi</a>, <a href="http://amti.csis.org/johnson-reef-tracker/">Johnson</a>, <a href="http://amti.csis.org/cuarteron-reef-tracker/">Cuarteron</a>, <a href="http://amti.csis.org/fiery-cross-reef-tracker/">Fiery Cross</a>, and <a href="http://amti.csis.org/hughes-reef-tracker/">Hughes</a> (McKennan) Reefs. For example, <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/ibru/publications/view/?id=229">in 1995</a>, Subi Reef was completely submerged at high tide. Today, there are 3.9 million square meters of reclaimed land above water at high tide on Subi Reef, and it is home to a pair of wooden barracks, communications array, and helipad. There are similarly stark changes at each of the other reefs.

Since <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/closindx.htm">UNCLOS</a> affords differing maritime based on the geographic characteristics of a given landmass, at first blush these changes could have big implications for both China and the Philippines. In particular, the Spratlys dispute involves three types of territorial objects at sea:
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/closindx.htm"><em>Low-tide elevation</em></a>: A landmass above water only at low tide. Outside an existing territorial sea it is not entitled to a separate maritime zone.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/closindx.htm"><em>Rock</em></a>: A landmass permanently above water but unable to sustain human habitation or economic life on its own. It is entitled to a territorial sea and contiguous zone, but not an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) or continental shelf rights.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/closindx.htm"><em>Island</em></a>: A landmass permanently above water that can sustain human habitation or economic life on its own. It is entitled to a territorial sea, contiguous zone, EEZ, and continental shelf rights.</li>
</ol>
<a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/JBT-Photo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3657 size-large" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/JBT-Photo-1024x592.jpg" alt="JBT Photo" width="640" height="370" /></a>

Before land reclamation, Johnson, Cuarteron, and Fiery Cross Reefs were rocks and the other reefs were, at most, low-tide elevations. After land reclamation, <em>all</em> six features would be considered rocks, if not islands. So the key question becomes: do we define the reefs’ legal character by looking at the facts from before or after land reclamation?

<strong><em>Artificial Islands Do Not Generate Maritime Entitlements</em></strong>

According to UNCLOS, an island is: “a <em>naturally formed</em> area of land, surrounded by water, which is above water at high tide.” For the Philippines to make its case, it must show that reclaimed land should not be considered “a naturally formed area of land.” You wouldn’t have to break the English language to find some ambiguity in the UNCLOS definition of an island. It could mean islands formed by natural processes <em>or</em> islands composed of naturally occurring objects.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> If the second definition is correct, reclaimed land would be entitled to all the maritime zones of an island.

But this expansive interpretation just does not hold water. The <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201155/volume-1155-I-18232-English.pdf">Vienna Convention</a> on the Law of Treaties says that we must give treaty provisions their “ordinary meaning” while remaining mindful of their context, purpose and, if necessary, negotiating history.

Let’s start with ordinary meaning. The New Oxford American Dictionary’s first entry for the verb ‘form’ defines it as to “bring together parts or combine to create (something).” So UNCLOS’ requirement that an island be naturally formed should mean that an island be <em>created</em> naturally.

It would not make sense to interpret “naturally formed” as a noun. We can see this is true by looking at other UNCLOS provisions. For example, <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/closindx.htm">Article 60</a> says that countries may “establish reasonable safety zones around … artificial islands” and that “[a]rtificial islands, installations and structures do not possess the status of islands.” UNCLOS does not define “artificial island” explicitly, but a definition is suggested by the fact that Article 60 differentiates artificial islands, installations, and structures. Installations and structures ordinarily include objects built of non-natural materials (like concrete and steel in an oil rig). By using “artificial islands” as a separate term, UNCLOS states that this is a different type of landmass, one that is made of natural objects (i.e. sand) and <em>not </em>man-made objects (i.e. steel).

If artificial islands are made of natural objects, it would not make sense for UNCLOS to define islands as a landmass <em>also </em>made of natural objects. The only solution, therefore, is for “naturally formed” to indicate the <em>process</em> by which an island is created.

This interpretation is confirmed by the Convention’s negotiating history. Although there were initially some scholars who thought artificially formed islands should be treated like natural islands, by 1958 they had largely lost the debate.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>  In fact, the United States specifically added “naturally formed” before “area of land” during negotiations culminating in the UNCLOS text to eliminate most maritime entitlements for artificial islands<em>.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><strong>[3]</strong></a></em> Since then, scholars have agreed that artificially formed islands should not be granted maritime entitlements.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>

<strong><em>International Tribunals Do Not Consider Construction After the Critical Date </em></strong>

It is possible, however, that the tribunal will not even have to consider this interpretive question because PRC land reclamation occurred after what is called the “critical date.” The critical date is the time when “the dispute crystallized”<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> between two parties (here, the PRC and Philippines). In a dispute between <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/124/17164.pdf">Nicaragua and Colombia</a> regarding Caribbean islands, for example, the critical date was when the two countries exchanged diplomatic notes explicitly claiming sovereignty over the islands after Nicaragua issued oil contracts in the surrounding waters. A tribunal will generally only consider the facts of a dispute as they existed <em>prior</em> to this date.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>

It is not clear if the Tribunal will fix a critical date in the Spratlys dispute, or what it will be if it does so. It may decline to indicate a date because the Philippines is not arguing for territorial sovereignty over these reefs. But assuming that arbitrators do use the critical date, there are three options: 1947 (when the Nationalist government of China <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/25/us-china-sea-boundary-idUSBRE84O07520120525">first endorsed</a> the Nine-Dashed Line) sometime in the 1970s (when the <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/mysvnm33_09/chn_2011_re_phl_e.pdf">PRC alleges</a> that the Philippines first occupied maritime features in the region) or April 14, 2011 (when the PRC <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/mysvnm33_09/chn_2011_re_phl_e.pdf">responded to a diplomatic note</a> from the Philippines protesting the Nine-Dash Line). Given the Nicaragua/Colombia dispute this third option seems most likely, but much could be disputed about the merits of each date. Regardless, it is clear that all three options occurred well before PRC land reclamation began approximately 18 months ago. The current geographic characteristics of these reefs, therefore, simply would not matter.

It is important to note that the Tribunal has not released the Philippines’ legal briefs, so we cannot be certain what topics have been addressed. But since more than <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/87100-philippines-supplemental-memorial-china">3000 pages</a> of briefing materials have been submitted, it is safe to assume that the Philippines has addressed all plausible arguments (both UNCLOS interpretation the critical date).

<em> </em><strong><em>Final Thoughts</em></strong>

The China-Philippines arbitration implicates a region in which nearly all neighboring states have sovereign claims. But while there are a number of difficult legal and strategic issues for the Permanent Court of Arbitration to consider, the legal character of PRC-controlled reefs is not one of them. Here, if anywhere, a straightforward application of UNCLOS should prevail. No amount of land reclamation can change a reef into an island, nor entitle them to an island’s maritime zones.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Philippines’ lawfare (legal warfare) against China has reached a critical juncture. More than two years after initiating compulsory arbitration against China, the Southeast Asian country faces the crucial task of proving that the Arbitral Tribunal, formed under the aegis of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), has the mandate to exercise jurisdiction on the South China Sea disputes.

Unless the Philippines manages to overcome the jurisdictional hurdle, which many legal experts consider  a formidable obstacle, it will not be able to meaningfully leverage international legal regimes to alter China’s calculus in the South China Sea. What is at stake, however, is not only the peaceful resolution of an increasingly intense maritime jostling in one of the world’s most important sea lines of communications (SLOCs), but also the very credibility of international legal instruments as the ultimate arbiter of interstate relations.

Underscoring the relevance of the ongoing hearings at The Hague, as many <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/98775-philippines-china-vietnam-observers-hague">as five Asian countries</a> have sent representatives to observe the viability of the Philippines’ legal maneuvers against China. Vietnam, Japan, and Malaysia, which are also locked in bitter territorial disputes with China, are carefully assessing whether the UNCLOS could serve as a useful framework to manage, if not resolve, intractable territorial disputes in the Western Pacific.

Meanwhile, Philippine-China diplomatic relations have reached a new nadir, with the Aquino administration <a href="http://www.manilatimes.net/rejecting-chinese-offer-a-bad-decision/199013/">rejecting any bilateral dialogue</a> with its powerful neighbor. For now, Manila seems to be putting all its eggs in the legal basket, <a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/07/03/1472862/philippines-sends-top-execs-south-china-sea-arbitration">dispatching top officials</a> from all branches of the state to attend the Hague hearings.

<strong>An Uncertain Challenge </strong>

The Philippines is the only country to have resorted to compulsory arbitration (under Art. 287 and <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/annex7.htm">Annex VII</a> of UNCLOS) against China, with its case resting on <a href="http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/98839-philippines-china-hague-arguments-explanation">at least five key arguments</a>. Primarily, the Philippines is questioning China’s claim to “historical rights” over the South China Sea based on a range of <a href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/world/chinas-false-memory-syndrome">dubious claims and ancient maps</a>. These, in turn, constitute the foundations of its <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/234936.pdf">notorious Nine-Dashed-Line claims</a>.

The Philippines has also called on the Tribunal to clarify (under Art. 121 of UNCLOS) the nature of disputed features in the South China Sea. While Beijing tends to characterize most of these features as islands, which can generate their own 200 nautical miles Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) and continental shelves, Manila instead claims that at most they are only rocks and high-tide elevations, which can generate a maximum of 12 nautical miles territorial seas. The Philippines rejects any overlap in EEZs with China, the southernmost shore (Hainan) of which lies <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/28/us-southchinasea-china-fishing-insight-idUSKBN0FW0QP20140728">almost 670 miles</a> away from the island chain. For many countries, the bulk of the features in the South China Sea are low-tide elevations, meaning they cannot be legally appropriated at all.

Closer to home, the Philippines is also seeking compulsory arbitration against <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2012/07/201273093650328417.html">China’s forcible acquisition</a> of the Scarborough Shoal in mid-2012, continued deployment of paramilitary patrols to intimidate and disrupt the activities of Filipino fishermen and troops within its EEZ, and various <a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/100676/security-expert-china-after-oil-rich-rector-bank-too">forms of intimidation</a> tactics, which <a href="http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/445665/economy/companies/phl-stops-oil-and-gas-drilling-in-reed-bank-cites-dispute-with-china">have prevented</a> the Philippines from developing its hydrocarbon resources in the area, especially in the Reed Bank. The Philippines has <a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/07/09/1475007/day-2-hague-philippines-presents-environmental-fishing-claims-vs-china">also raised concerns</a> over the tremendously destructive <a href="http://amti.csis.org/the-other-crisis-in-the-south-china-sea/">environmental impact</a> of China’s massive land reclamation activities and relentless exploitation of marine and fisheries resources across the South China Sea.

China’s primary counter-strategy, however, is to nip the legal challenge in the bud by raising procedural-technicality questions. These were laid out in its 2014 <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1217147.shtml">position paper</a>, which can be read as an informal <em>counter-memorial. </em>

<strong>The Way Forward </strong>

The arbitration bodies under UNCLOS do not have the mandate to rule over sovereignty-related questions. China also reiterates its <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_declarations.htm#China%20Upon ratification">2006 declaration</a>, whereby it cited exemptions (under <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part15.htm">Art. 298</a> of UNCLOS) against third-party arbitration over issues that concern territorial claims, among others. China also contends that the Philippines has prematurely sought third-party arbitration, since the Southeast Asian country has supposedly not exhausted alternative mechanisms such as bilateral negotiations.

The challenge for the Philippines, therefore, is to prove that its case transcends sovereignty-related questions and that compulsory arbitration is a justified approach in light of the <a href="http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/470366/news/nation/dfa-chief-phl-ran-into-dead-end-when-it-tried-to-resolve-sea-disputes-with-china">alleged inefficacy and exhaustion</a> of alternative mechanisms. This will not be easy. Legal experts are divided on whether the Philippines can decisively overcome the jurisdiction question. But if it manages to do so, then China is vulnerable to similar suits from countries like Vietnam, which are carefully observing whether the UNCLOS is a viable tool to push back against Chinese maritime expansionism.

Given the importance of the South China Sea to regional trade and transport of energy resources, almost all countries have an interest in preventing a single power from coercively <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/chinas-mad-dash-the-south-china-sea-12866">dominating the area</a> at the expense of freedom of navigation and overflight. This is why it is crucial for the Tribunal to seek Chinese clarifications regarding its concept of “historical rights/waters” as well as its sweeping Nine-Dash Line claims. Astonishingly, Beijing is <a href="http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2015/01/11/why-us-analysis-of-chinas-nine-dash-line-is-flawed/">yet to clarify</a> the precise coordinates of and legal justifications underpinning its South China Sea claims.

The Philippines is engaged in a crucial effort to ensure all claimant states align their claims in accordance to prevailing international legal regimes. Bilateral engagement with China, however, is a strategic inevitability. If the Tribunal turns down jurisdiction, however, then the formation of a “conciliation commission” (under <a href="https://www.google.com.ph/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.un.org%2Fdepts%2Flos%2Fconvention_agreements%2Ftexts%2Funclos%2Fannex5.htm&amp;ei=DQSfVe7WGMvEgwTn76vwCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3d6y3oaiYgiBLszS_-JB6SMK1pQ&amp;sig2=B30m1U7b4LkE4tArAZvqdw&amp;bvm=bv.96952980,d.eXY">Annex V</a> of UNCLOS) is another option to seek third-party advisory on the status and validity of claims in the South China Sea. Even if the Philippines overcomes the jurisdiction hurdle, it will still need to bilaterally engage with China.

After all, the Tribunal has no mechanism to enforce any unfavorable verdict against China, while it is extremely crucial for Manila and Beijing to at least maintain some dialogue on establishing much-needed confidence-building measures to avoid accidental clashes and military escalation in the increasingly-congested Spratlys. The Aquino administration may have <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/david-vs-goliath-the-south-china-sea-the-philippines-vs-11534">placed too much emphasis</a> on its inherently uncertain lawfare at the expense of much-needed bilateral dialogue with its powerful neighbor, which seems determined to snub and defy the ongoing hearing at The Hague at all costs.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Annex VII arbitral <a href="http://www.pca-cpa.org/showfile.asp?fil_id=3000">tribunal heard oral arguments</a> from the Philippines last week on the issues of jurisdiction and admissibility of claims in the case it launched against China. Despite high hopes placed on Manila’s cause, these issues remain the most formidable legal obstacles to be surmounted. While the Philippine Memorial has not been made public, the original <a href="http://www.dfa.gov.ph/index.php/component/docman/doc_download/56-notification-and-statement-of-claim-on-west-philippine-sea?Itemid=546">Notification and Statement of Claims</a> enumerates at least 13 different claims for relief, some of which may include further subsidiary claims. Each of these may have individual or interlocking questions of jurisdiction and admissibility, making for a rather complicated case that must be laid out carefully and argued meticulously.

Like Scylla and Charybdis of ancient maritime lore, jurisdiction and admissibility could spell disaster for Manila’s current legal effort to address the dispute if it fails to persuade the tribunal. It has not exactly been smooth sailing: the decision to consider these issues as preliminary questions and hold separate oral arguments already falls out of step with the announced <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/52764-philippines-china-arbitral-tribunal-jurisdiction">Philippine preference for the tribunal to deal with both</a> jurisdiction and merits simultaneously and expeditiously.

The purpose of the oral arguments at this stage is only to convince the tribunal of two things: first, that it does have the authority to decide on the claims presented by the Philippines (jurisdiction), and second, such claims are actually ripe for decision (admissibility). The need for oral arguments in addition to the written pleadings arise from <a href="http://www.pca-cpa.org/showfile.asp?fil_id=2910">the tribunal’s independent appreciation</a> of Manila’s memorial and supplemental submission, as well as China’s position paper and all previous communications. By this time, the matter has been extensively discussed in nearly <a href="http://www.dfa.gov.ph/index.php/newsroom/dfa-releases/5667-statement-on-the-philippines-supplemental-submission-to-the-arbitral-tribunal">500 pages of pleadings</a> supported by <a href="http://www.gov.ph/2014/03/30/statement-of-the-secretary-of-foreign-affairs-ph-files-memorial-under-unclos-against-china/">7000 pages of supporting documents and data</a>; the conduct of oral arguments suggests that despite these, not all issues have been fully threshed out to the tribunal’s satisfaction.

Beijing’s <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1217147.shtml">principal jurisdictional objections</a> are that it has not consented to the arbitration proceedings; the core of the disputes are sovereignty over the islands and features in the South China Sea; and the Philippine claims are covered by China’s optional exclusions to compulsory dispute settlement under UNCLOS since they require prior maritime delimitations in order to be granted. It further objects to their admission for arbitration on account of its insistence that no prior negotiations have been conducted on the specific claims; the arbitration contravenes earlier commitments to resolve the disputes through consultation and negotiations; and Manila’s unilateral resort to arbitration constitutes an abuse of rights under UNCLOS.

Manila addresses these objections by insisting that China’s ratification of UNCLOS includes consent to Annex VII arbitration on issues of interpretation and application of UNCLOS, under which all its claims fall; it does not seek resolution of sovereignty issues; and it does not require maritime boundary delimitations to determine its rights, but only a declaration of the proper entitlements of the contested features. It also argues that it has in fact engaged in fruitless negotiations with China for the past two decades, the deadlock arising from Beijing’s excessive claims to most of the South China Sea (represented by the Nine-Dash Line map) based on historic rights or title in contravention of UNCLOS; this justifies resort to arbitration. Several days of hearings amplified and detailed <a href="http://www.pca-cpa.org/showfile.asp?fil_id=3005">these arguments</a> as they pertained specifically to each and every one of Manila’s numerous claims for relief from grievances with China.

<a href="http://www.gov.ph/2015/07/07/statement-of-secretary-albert-del-rosario-before-the-permanent-court-of-arbitration-peace-palace-the-hague-netherlands/">As highlighted by the Philippines</a>, the decision on jurisdiction and admissibility could jeopardize the credibility and viability of UNCLOS and its dispute settlement mechanisms. It has portrayed UNCLOS and the Rule of Law as the great equalizer between maritime nations, big and small; the political impact and historical significance of exercising jurisdiction over the South China Sea disputes is eminently attractive if it could take the regional legal situation a step closer toward clarity and resolution. But, Beijing still casts a long shadow; despite absence from the proceedings, its out-of-court counter-factual allegations and jurisdictional objections clearly have enough legal traction for the tribunal to not dismiss them out of hand.

After conclusion of the oral arguments, the tribunal gave China an opportunity to comment on the arguments, and <a href="http://www.pca-cpa.org/showfile.asp?fil_id=3005">will take until the end of the year to decide</a> on these preliminary questions. The case now depends on at least one of the Philippine’s claims being within the tribunal’s jurisdiction; those pertaining to the validity of China’s Nine-Dashed Line and the jurisdictional entitlements of maritime features remain the most important. If favorably decided, the proceedings may stretch well into 2016 to tackle the merits; if not, then Manila might find its legal case abruptly ended and need to completely rethink its entire approach to the SCS disputes. Either way, the oral arguments represent one more leg in a challenging voyage toward legal certainty in the SCS.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Long-standing disagreements concerning territorial sovereignty over the Spratly Islands lie at the core of the PRC’s maritime disputes in the South China Sea. The Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan each claim sovereign title to some or all of the hundreds of features clustered in that vital waterway. Among the reasons for the recent intensity of these disputes are contested jurisdictional entitlements to maritime zones projecting out from those islands. Indeed, the various small islands, reefs, and atolls of the Spratlys have little value in and of themselves – even as lily pad military installations – but punch well above their weight if they generate territorial seas and exclusive economic zones (EEZs) for their sovereign.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> This jurisdictional component is the substance of the Philippines’ ongoing Annex VII UNCLOS arbitral suit against the PRC, and highlights a salient feature of the PRC’s position in the disputes: its seemingly extravagant claims to “maritime rights and interests,” backed up by a growing body of domestic laws, regulations and rules.

China’s so-called maritime rights and interests [国家海洋权益] are a staple of PRC discourse on its maritime disputes, yet remain frustratingly ambiguous – even in specialized reports by the government agencies tasked with administering and regulating the maritime space in question.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> The “interests,” while apparently expanding in lockstep with Chinese capabilities and overseas equities, are clear enough: China seeks to push out interior defensive lines,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> secure exclusive rights to potentially rich resources, and make good on long-running nationalist propaganda hyping the “unification” of lost territory.

The connection between interests and legal rights, however, is obscure. There is remarkable imprecision in PRC code about the <em>scope </em>and <em>content </em>of China’s putative maritime rights in the waters surrounding the Spratlys.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> Whereas the PRC declared baselines surrounding its other contested island claims (to the Paracel Islands in 1996, and to the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands in 2012), Beijing has yet to make such a declaration regarding the Spratlys. Why is this the case? Which substantive rights does the PRC claim in maritime zones surrounding the Spratlys? Are they uniform throughout the waters circumscribed by the notorious U-shaped line? What are the practical implications of China’s undefined jurisdictional claims in these contested waters?

Beijing’s apparent interest in maintaining an ambiguous posture with respect to its desired sovereign rights and specific jurisdiction arise from both strategy and incapacity. Strategically, studied ambiguity allows the PRC to tailor its maritime law enforcement (MLE) practices to match the varied operational and diplomatic demands thrown up by intermittent spikes in conflict over specific parts of the South China Sea; it also affords a degree of flexibility for Beijing to determine the time and place of those confrontations. From a bargaining standpoint, it gives China a bit more house money to gamble away in an eventually settlement: it is not a loss if China does not ultimately enjoy rights that it never formally claimed or exercised.

Whatever the strategic merits of this position, Beijing may also be unable to articulate a proper claim. This inference is supported by observation of China’s evident <em>incapacity</em> to effectively and continuously administer and control all of the space within the U-shaped line. That incapacity is not merely a function of inadequate resources and personnel to patrol all of the waters. There has been a 25% increase in deployed MLE vessels over the past decade – many of which are large, capable People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) vessels painted white and granted various “jurisdictional” competencies.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> It is also a function of China’s dysfunctional domestic legal order. China suffers from insufficient legal expertise and endemic disrespect for law within the Party, government, and Chinese society at large. These legal shortcomings exacerbate inadequate political will at the center to definitively and unequivocally announce maritime claims. Why do so when weak legal institutions in the PRC cannot effectively direct central, provincial, and local actors and agencies to adhere to legal rules?

This legal incapacity is palpable in national laws intended to bring the PRC into something resembling compliance with UNCLOS, which it ratified in 1996. These broad legislative pronouncements are only slowly but incompletely being implemented through State Council administrative regulations, and departmental and local rules. The process of importing UNCLOS rules and norms into domestic code is complicated – and perhaps fatally compromised – by a political-legal system deeply penetrated and distorted by political forces. The 1982 PRC Constitution makes no express provisions for incorporating treaty law, and those lower-level legal instruments that purport to do so always use indeterminate language that, in practice, permits <em>ad hoc </em>political discretion to override international legal obligations (e.g., the 1990 Law on the Procedure of the Conclusion of Treaties). This despite the fact that President Xi prioritized the campaign to “rule the country by law” [依法治国] at the Fourth Plenum of the 18<sup>th</sup> Party Congress in October 2014, and enshrined that goal as one of his “Four Comprehensives” [四个全面] for governance early this year.

Tracking dysfunction in PRC law more generally, the practical realization of a maritime legal <em>system</em> remains quite a ways off. So too, are legally cognizable PRC claims to maritime jurisdiction in disputed waters. The existing domestic legal regime might be better rendered as the PRC’s “maritime legal scheme,” and consists of a variety of laws, rules and regulations that partially delegate tasks to administrative agencies, vaguely promote environmental conservation, and prescribe hazy procedures and regulations for the economic and scientific use of China’s still-undefined “three million square kilometers” of claimed maritime jurisdictional space. Some two thirds of that space is in the South China Sea yet only the narrow band of territorial sea (12nm) surrounding the Chinese mainland, Hainan Island, and the disputed Paracel island group can be said to have a definite and comprehensive set of rights and obligations within PRC law. The Spratlys are represented only in a shrill – but <em>prima facie </em>legitimate – claim to sovereignty.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> Users of the congested space surrounding and above these features are waiting for the other shoe to drop in terms of PRC law and practice.

What does this imply for other users of the vast but undefined area that the PRC represents as an area of some type of “historical” rights?<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> For the territorial claimants (<em>viz.,</em> the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan), it is certain from PRC legislation that China intends to exercise something amounting to full sovereignty over the insular features within the U-shaped line; they can further discern that Beijing believes these features (collectively or individually) generate a territorial sea, EEZ, and continental shelf.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> Where, exactly, that U-shaped line is, how it relates to UNCLOS zones, and how those zones map out given opposing coastlines within 200nm, however, remains a mystery.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> Growing Chinese capacity to operate in that area has made it clear that the 12nm surrounding the eight PRC-occupied features in the Spratlys are off limits, a circumstance that has obtained at least since the 2012 Scarborough Shoal standoff. Whether and how the PRC’s putative rights and interests will be asserted in the waters beyond 12nm remains unknown, though the placement of the CNOOC Haiyang Shiyou 981 17nm from the nearest PRC-occupied feature in May 2014 is a strong indication that EEZ rights will be asserted if and when China has capacity to do so.

For the non-territorial claimants, the story is even more confusing. For example, Indonesia has an undisputed claim to the Natuna Islands in the southwest part of the South China Sea. These populous islands rate an EEZ, which easily projects into the area enclosed by the U-shaped line yet does not come within 200nm of any Spratly feature. If China intends to translate its claim to “maritime rights and interests” in this area into a legal claim sovereign rights and jurisdiction, Indonesia will further intensify its domestic campaign to build capacity to effectively administer and control its UNCLOS-defined zones. Growing friction between Chinese and Indonesian MLE vessels and fishermen in this area is the product of as-yet unaccountable Chinese exercises of maritime rights.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>

For the United States, a non-claimant but frequent user of the South China Sea, the imprecision of Chinese rights claims is also problematic. If China intends to treat the waters beyond 12nm of claimed features as EEZ, the problem is at least fairly well-defined: China claims a right to regulate (and, effectively, prohibit) foreign military activities within its EEZs. Rules regulating such conduct remain unarticulated in PRC domestic law, but diplomatic statements coupled with periodic operational contestation of U.S. Navy intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) operations makes it clear enough that the PRC hopes to deny access for US military vessels and aircraft in as broad a swathe of maritime space as possible. If, however, China intends to claim something more than EEZ rights – which appears to be the case, based on intermittent efforts to prohibit US military aircraft from transiting international airspace above its putative EEZ – then the imprecision in China’s maritime legal scheme will pose a growing problem as China steadily resolves its incapacity issues. Continued U.S. freedom of navigation (FON) assertions are likely to draw out this distinction over time, but may generate unintended and escalatory encounters in South China Sea airspace that spike Chinese nationalism and further politicize the messy process of defining PRC claims in domestic law.

To conclude, the development of “maritime rights and interests” in PRC law provides insights into how Beijing prosecutes its disputed claims: by converting its growing geopolitical interests in the Asian littoral into cognizable legal rights. All that is missing is sufficient capacity – legally and operationally – to practically enforce them. In representing their claims in terms of capital-L “Law,” PRC leaders aim to extract maximum legitimacy for Chinese claims – all without actually submitting to the legal restraints that would in fact make their actions lawful and legitimate. While UNCLOS-based legal instruments will not necessarily constrain PRC freedom of action, attention to the pseudo-legal domestic basis for a variety of “assertive” PRC behaviors offers a privileged glimpse into Beijing’s maritime playbook.

<a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> The criteria for whether a feature can be considered an island and entitled to the full panoply of maritime zones are laid out in UNCLOS III Article 121, but the indeterminacy of the language of that short article leaves significant doubt about the entitlements of all but the most substantial of islands.

<a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> The PRC Ministry of Land and Resources’ State Oceanic Administration publishes a comprehensive annual report on “China’s Ocean Development” that has included a section on “maritime rights and interests” since 2013, but even this document resists specifying the specific jurisdiction claimed in non-UNCLOS zones.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Philippines has been widely applauded for bringing the first ever arbitration case relating to the South China Sea disputes before an UNCLOS Arbitration Tribunal, but it still needs to clear the three hurdles of jurisdiction, admissibility and merit. In other words, Manila needs to prove that its case falls within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, that there is nothing to disqualify the case, and, finally, that the complaints therein should be upheld. There is little doubt that China’s various claims over the maritime expanse roughly defined by its infamous Nine-Dash Line violate international law of maritime delimitation, but it is nonetheless far from certain that the Philippines will clear all three hurdles for all of its claims.
<h1>First line of defence</h1>
Although China has boycotted the legal proceedings, it has indirectly delivered its arguments to the Tribunal by publishing a paper laying out its arguments.<sup>[1]</sup> These arguments deploy three main lines of defence that focus on the first two hurdles, jurisdiction and admissibility.

First, China argues that:
<blockquote><em>[t]he essence of the subject-matter of the arbitration is the territorial sovereignty over several maritime features in the South China Sea, which is beyond the scope of the Convention and does not concern the interpretation or application of the Convention;</em></blockquote>
UNCLOS accords the Tribunal jurisdiction to answer questions that relate to the interpretation and application of the Convention, and it is generally accepted that this does not include those whose essence is territorial sovereignty. Any of the Philippines’ claims which fall foul of this condition will be outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

In reality, this line of defence is misplaced. What the Philippines claims is that Scarborough Reef and the Spratlys are either not islands, or they are islands that are not entitled to an exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The essence of this claim is physical geography, not territorial sovereignty. For features that are naturally submerged at high tide and are more than 12 nautical miles from islands, territorial sovereignty does not even exist. For those that are naturally above water at high tide, whether they are entitled to an EEZ or not depends on interpretation and application of UNCLOS’s Article 121(3), which has nothing to do with territorial sovereignty, and is therefore completely within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The Philippines’ summary of its case at the hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility alludes to the use of these arguments to bypass China’s first line of defence:<sup>[2]</sup>
<blockquote><em>... the various maritime features relied upon by China as a basis upon which to assert its claims in the South China Sea are not islands that generate entitlement to an exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.  Rather, some are “rocks” within the meaning of Article 121, paragraph 3; others are low-tide elevations; and still others are permanently submerged. As a result, none are capable of generating entitlements beyond 12M, and some generate no entitlements at all.</em></blockquote>
<h1>Second line of defence</h1>
China further argues that:
<blockquote><em>Even assuming, arguendo, that the subject-matter of the arbitration were concerned with the interpretation or application of the Convention, that subject-matter would constitute an integral part of maritime delimitation between the two countries, thus falling within the scope of the declaration filed by China in 2006 in accordance with the Convention, which excludes, </em>inter alia<em>, disputes concerning maritime delimitation from compulsory arbitration and other compulsory dispute settlement procedures;</em></blockquote>
If Scarborough Reef or some of the Spratly features are entitled to an EEZ, then there will be an overlap of this EEZ entitlement and the EEZ entitlements of Palawan and Luzon. If that were the case, and if the Philippines had asked the Tribunal to divide up the area of overlapping entitlements, that would have been a matter of maritime delimitation, and the Tribunal would not have jurisdiction to do so.

In reality, China's second line of defence is also misplaced. The Philippines’s claim regarding Scarborough Reef and the Spratlys, namely that:
<blockquote><em>… some are “rocks” within the meaning of Article 121, paragraph 3; others are low-tide elevations; and still others are permanently submerged. As a result, none are capable of generating entitlements beyond 12M, and some generate no entitlements at all.</em></blockquote>
is not about delimitation but about interpretation and application of UNCLOS’s Article 121(3), which, as stated earlier, is entirely within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

The Philippines’ case also includes two other substantial claims, neither of which is affected by China’s first two lines of defence:
<blockquote><em>... China is not entitled to exercise what it refers to as “historic rights” over the waters, seabed and subsoil beyond the limits of its entitlements under the Convention;</em>

<em>... China has irreversibly damaged the regional marine environment, in breach of UNCLOS, by its destruction of coral reefs in the South China Sea, including areas within the Philippines’ EEZ, by its destructive and hazardous fishing practices, and by its harvesting of endangered species.</em></blockquote>
<h1>Third line of defence</h1>
Finally, China argues that:
<blockquote><em>China and the Philippines have agreed, through bilateral instruments and the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, to settle their relevant disputes through negotiations. By unilaterally initiating the present arbitration, the Philippines has breached its obligation under international law;</em></blockquote>
If the Philippines has a legal obligation not to take China to court, this case will be inadmissible.

The article of the Declaration of Conduct (DOC) that China refers to states that:<sup>[3]</sup>
<blockquote><em>The Parties concerned undertake to resolve their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful means, without resorting to the threat or use of force, through friendly consultations and negotiations by sovereign states directly concerned, in accordance with universally recognized principles of international law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea;</em></blockquote>
In practice, both China and ASEAN, as well as senior Chinese scholars, have taken the view that the DOC does not give rise to legal obligations.<sup>[4]</sup> Furthermore, given China’s strident assertion of “indisputable sovereignty” and its policy of not negotiating the sovereignty issue, which it terms the “essence of the subject matter”, it is disingenuous for Beijing to claim that the only means available to the Philippines for settling territorial and jurisdictional disputes is negotiation. If the Tribunal agrees with that disingenuous argument, it will condemn the Philippines to an absurd predicament: no recourse but to negotiate resolution of the disputes with a country that does not negotiate but, instead, uses paramilitary forces to seize control. Therefore it would be extremely unfair for the Tribunal to uphold China’s third line of defence.
<h1>Dilemma and risk</h1>
In summary, China’s three lines of defence are unlikely to stop the Philippines’ case at the hurdles of jurisdiction and admissibility.

If this turned out to be true, China would face a serious dilemma. It could continue to boycott the legal proceedings, but its justification for the boycott in terms of lack of jurisdiction and inadmissibility would have been proven false already. Furthermore, continuing to deliver its arguments via the court room’s window by publishing “position papers” is not a dignified course of action for a superpower. Alternatively, Beijing could come inside to argue its case, which would be a step down from its current position, and, more importantly, would make it even harder for it to disregard rulings that go against it.

For the Philippines, even if its case cleared the hurdles of jurisdiction and admissibility, there is still a major risk at the merit hurdle.

The Philippines’ rejection of “historic rights” as a basis for claims over the maritime space inside the Nine Dash Line seems well-founded in law.<sup>[5]</sup> Its claim regarding the marine environment also seems strong, especially considering China’s massive island-building projects on coral reefs since 2014.

However, the heart of the Philippines’ case, and where the greatest risk lies, is the claim that the Spratlys and Scarborough Reef are not entitled to EEZs. There is little doubt that the Tribunal will uphold this claim for Scarborough Reef, which only has a few rocks above high tide. The Spratlys, on the other hand, include a handful of islands that range in size from 0.1 to 0.5 km², and it has never been determined in court whether or not UNCLOS’s Article 121(3) denies such islands an EEZ. In analogous cases, international courts and Tribunals were able to take advantage of maritime delimitation principles to ignore such islands without having to interpret and apply this article, so it has remained a grey area. Not having the jurisdiction to apply maritime delimitation principles, this Tribunal will have little choice but to embark on an interpretation of this controversial article. If it ruled that this article applies to the Spratlys, the disputed waters in that area would be restricted to 12 nautical miles around the islands, which would improve the regional security situation enormously. If not, South China Sea would be condemned to ever more turmoil, confrontations, and the threat and use of force until, quite possibly, China’s military might allows it to impose its will on the other littoral states.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Although China is not the first state to build an airstrip in the South China Sea, it is the first state to employ island-building technologies to transform a contested maritime feature into a military base that extends the reach of offensive military capabilities. Other countries have worked to project power <em>to</em> contested South China Sea features; with the airstrip on Fiery Cross Reef, China has worked to project power <em>from</em> them.

For context, Beijing's efforts to militarize Fiery Cross Reef are only a small part of China's massive and controversial program to create a "Great Wall of Sand" across the South China Sea – in the words of the previous Commander of Pacific Fleet.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Beijing has gone far beyond traditional land development:<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> it has dredged and dumped enough sand in the South China Sea to create approximately 2,000 acres of artificial islands.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> While China claims that its island-building program is “beneficial to the whole of international society” because it will enable Beijing to project power across the South China Sea for search and rescue efforts,<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) disagrees. In a statement released in April, ASEAN leadership found that China’s island-creation program had “eroded trust and confidence and may undermine peace, security and stability.”<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>

To understand how different China's behavior is – and how distinct Fiery Cross Reef's airstrip is – a chronological summary of the rival claimants’ airfield construction and modernization activities might be useful:
<ul>
	<li>In 2003, Malaysia completed the modernization of its 1983 Layang-Layang Airport on Swallow Reef with a 1,360-meter airfield. <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> The airfield can technically support small civilian and military aircraft, but functionally serves as little more than a way to get tourists to and from Swallow Reef.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></li>
	<li>In 2004, Vietnam began work to rebuild an airfield on Big Spratly that had been abandoned since it had served the South Vietnamese in the 1970s.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> The 600-meter airstrip is technically capable of receiving small fixed-wing propeller aircraft, and Vietnam reportedly plans to use it, along with cruises, to help make the island a tourist destination, which could be seen as a means of asserting its sovereignty.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></li>
	<li>In 2006, Taiwan began work on its airfield of approximately 1,200 meters in length on Taiping Island (also known as Itu Aba).<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> In February 2008, President Chen Shui-bian flew to the island on a ROC Air Force C-130 transport plane and gave a speech at a ceremony marking the opening of the newly completed airport.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> Although Vietnam and other South China Sea claimants took issue with these developments,<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> China did not directly criticize President Chen’s visit or the construction of the airstrip.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a> In recent years, Taiwan has also engaged in a Taiping Island project that includes renovation of its port facilities and improvements to the airfield.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></li>
	<li>In 2014, the Philippines announced plans to modernize an airfield on Thitu (Pagasa) Island that was built “sometime in the 1970s, out of packed sand and coral debris."<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> Manila reconsidered these modernization efforts, however, owing to concerns that related port construction efforts might violate the Declaration of Conduct (DOC) for the South China Sea.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> The 1,300-meter strip has thus remained in its unpaved and "dilapidated” state, as a video from May 2015 (showing a C-130 carrying AFP Chief General Gregorio Catapang Jr. landing there) illustrates.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></li>
	<li>In 2014, China began its unprecedented work on Fiery Cross Reef, which it first occupied in 1987 and initially updated in 1988. Beijing has since increased the area of the reef to about eleven times its previous size.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> In July of this year, evidence emerged that China is finalizing modernization of its 3,000-meter airstrip at Fiery Cross Reef; this facility appears to be capable of supporting almost any type of aircraft in China’s inventory.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> Beijing insists that its island construction is intended mainly for non-military purposes, but it also admits that its objectives include improving its ability to safeguard what it regards as its “territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests,” and that these reclamation activities will help “satisfy the necessary military defense needs.”<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></li>
</ul>
Although Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan, and the Philippines built their own airfields in the area well before China commenced its massive island building and military construction program last year – and other countries are now working to maintain or improve some of their facilities – Beijing’s activities are on a scale that vastly exceeds what any of its rival claimants are capable of doing. Beijing’s island building and airfield construction at Fiery Cross Reef appears aimed not only at strengthening its sovereignty claims, but also at extending its ability to project power into the South China Sea, where Beijing was previously constrained by distance from the Chinese mainland and the Chinese military’s relatively limited aerial refueling capabilities.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a> As Andrew Erickson observes, Beijing does not need a 3,000-meter runway “to support evacuation of personnel for medical or weather emergencies via turboprop and other civilian aircraft.” On the contrary, he said, “such a runway is only needed to support a full range of military options.”<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a> Indeed, the airfield could be used not only for purposes such as evacuations or emergency landings, but also to accommodate a variety of types of military aircraft, such as various types of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and combat aircraft. Although in the event of a regional crisis or conflict China’s new airfield could be vulnerable to attack, especially by a highly capable adversary, it might nonetheless offer China formidable options against its less capable rival claimants.

Even if China really sees itself as undertaking legitimate activities to protect its rightful interests, it should come as no surprise that China’s rival claimants, as well as the United States and other countries in the region, see Beijing’s island building and construction activities, like Fiery Cross Reef airfield, as efforts to improve China’s abilities to bully its neighbors. Some observers might even consider the process of improving these abilities to be, in and of itself, a bullying tactic. Accordingly, many have criticized China’s actions as destabilizing and urged Beijing to forsake such coercive tactics – and instead choose diplomacy to address its maritime territorial disputes.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>

A confrontation between China and Japan in the East China Sea continues mainly between Japan’s national coast guard ships and China’s government and civilian fishery vessels, but it seems to have reached a kind of moderate stalemate as the two governments have resumed working-level talks aimed at establishing a maritime communication mechanism between Japan and China. While the situation bears watching, U.S. statements reiterating that Article V of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, which obligates the United States to defend Japan, applies to the Senkaku islands, as well as the continuous presence of Japan’s coast guard and Maritime Self-Defense Forces around the islands, must have played a major role in achieving the current relative stability.

There also is increased tension in the South China Sea where Chinese land reclamation activities are making remarkable progress and “Beijing’s intention to exert greater control over the South China Sea appears undiminished.”<a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) expressed “serious concerns” in the chairman’s statement issued after the ASEAN summit meeting on April 27, 2015. However, land reclamation in the South China Sea is a tricky issue because there are no provisions in international law that specifically prohibit any state from pursuing reclamation at sea,<a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> and most of the international community does not take a position on the sovereignty of those islands. The strategy adopted by the Xi Jinping administration “does not rely on the use of force. Instead, China is engaged in ‘salami-slicing’—using small, incremental actions, none of which by itself is a <em>casus belli</em>.<a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>” That is why the possible responses from the international community including the United States are limited, and land reclamation is expected to make more progress without substantial policy measures to halt it even though China officially mentioned its intention to use facilities on reclaimed land for military purposes.<a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>

As a result, we are witnessing, as Vice Admiral Robert Thomas, commander of the U.S. 7th Fleet, depicted, “the Chinese fishing fleet, the Chinese coastguard and the (navy) overmatch their neighbors.”<a name="_ftnref5"></a><a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> This is why the United States and Japan are providing patrol boats to the Philippines and Vietnam, but this assistance is not enough for either government to realize a 24/7 presence in the area, which Japan has established around the Senkaku islands.

Admiral Thomas also mentioned the benefits of Japan’s possible provision of naval air patrols in the South China Sea, which would certainly help narrow the gap in maritime surveillance between China and other claimants. However, this idea currently does not fit the diplomatic policies of most of the countries concerned, as none of the Southeast Asian countries, nor the United States and Japan, are willing to take steps that could increase the risk of escalation and substantial military-to-military standoffs. If Japan’s naval aircraft were to patrol over the South China Sea regularly, we would likely see an increase in “near-misses” between military aircraft of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and Japan’s Self-Defense Forces and possibly accidental conflict.

Nonetheless, it seems that Admiral Thomas’s comment got to the heart of the matter in two important ways. First, patrol aircraft will definitely play a critical role as a force multiplier for those countries with a relatively smaller number of ships. The patrol boats of the Philippines and Vietnam can be deployed much more effectively with wider and timely surveillance coverage provided by patrol aircraft. Second, Japan and the United States will be able to play a key role in terms of capacity building, particularly in light of Japan’s decision last year to relax restrictions on arms exports. The recent summit meeting between President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe generated momentum for U.S.-Japan cooperation in this area, and a joint vision statement for the U.S.-Japan alliance issued on April 28, 2015, notes that both countries will “work more closely on issues including maritime security, and to partner with other countries that share our aspirations, in the region and beyond.”<a name="_ftnref6"></a><a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> New guidelines for U.S.-Japan defense cooperation issued on April 27, 2015, also explicitly stipulate that both countries will cooperate on maritime security and “Partner Capacity Building.”<a name="_ftnref7"></a><a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a>

Both U.S. secretary of defense Ashton Carter and Japanese minister of defense Gen Nakatani noted the importance of capacity building and multilateral cooperation in the maritime sphere in remarks at the recent Shangri-La Dialogue at the end of May. Secretary Carter referenced the peaceful resolution of conflicts, regional institutions, alliances and partnerships, capacity building, and developing habits of cooperation as guiding principles for the Asia-Pacific region and also announced a “Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative” as a means toward those ends.<a name="_ftnref8"></a><a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> Defense Minister Nakatani introduced the “Shangri-La Dialogue Initiative,” which includes the enhancement of maritime domain awareness as well as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities of ASEAN countries.<a name="_ftnref9"></a><a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a>

There are various options to tackle the issue of Chinese land reclamation in the South China Sea, but it is important to avoid actions that could escalate tensions. Developing the capabilities of regional countries will be most effective in solving the problem over the long term, and multilateral cooperation will be the key to success. Based on these circumstances, it might be beneficial for relevant governments to consider a concept for multilateral maritime patrols, introduced notionally here as the “Asian Multi-role Patrol Aircraft Coalition (AMPAC).” Key elements are as follows:

<strong>1)</strong><strong>      </strong><em><strong>“Coalition” (Operating Body):</strong></em> It would be desirable for the governments of the Philippines and Vietnam, with the participation of relevant partner countries, to jointly establish a civilian (nonmilitary) institution to conduct maritime and other patrol operations. “AMPAC” must be distinguished from their respective militaries, and the objectives should be limited to serving civilian needs, including maritime patrol and other surveillance operations such as those for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HA/DR), antipiracy, and antitrafficking. Staffing needs, including command and control structures, could be provided in large part by militaries, and the headquarters for AMPAC could reside within a military base. The partner countries, such as the United States and Japan, may also need to contribute in terms of staffing, and this is why the AMPAC should be regarded as a multilateral initiative. This concept might somewhat resemble the “Eyes in the Sky (EiS)” initiative launched by Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand in 2005, though EiS basically consists of combined maritime air patrols by militaries of several countries and therefore is interpreted as a form of military cooperation.

2)      <em><strong>Main Platform: </strong></em>Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Forces (MSDF) currently own over 70 P-3C maritime patrol aircraft, which are scheduled to be retired gradually after planned service years. It might be beneficial for the relevant countries to utilize those precious old P-3Cs, downgraded and stripped of military capabilities (such as antisubmarine capability), for the “coalition” instead of simply scrapping them.

3)      <em><strong>Operational/Technical Capability:</strong></em> The AMPAC needs to have both technical/maintenance and operational capabilities. The Ministry of Defense of Japan and the MSDF may be able to carry out capacity-building projects for AMPAC in this area, utilizing groups of retired MSDF officers. The U.S. Navy and the MSDF may need to coordinate with private industry such as Lockheed Martin and Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) to develop appropriate technical frameworks for downgrading the aircraft, particularly mission computers and maintenance postures. It might be logical for KHI, as the nearest depot-level maintenance contractor, to participate in the overall maintenance cycle of AMPAC aircraft. As for operational capability, the United States and other partnership countries such as Australia might support capacity-building initiatives for AMPAC.

4)<em><strong> Financing:</strong></em> By designing AMPAC as a civilian institution, it would be eligible for Official Development Assistance (ODA). Japan recently reviewed its ODA charter and introduced a new “Development Cooperation Charter,” which expands Japan’s ODA contributions to security-related fields.<a name="_ftnref10"></a><a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a> Even if Japan donates P-3Cs, financial resources would be required for operations and maintenance. Recipient countries would ideally bear those operational costs, but some ODA might be critical in realizing this concept. If Japan, the United States, Australia, and other partner countries can provide this kind of assistance, this concept will be even more feasible.

<em><strong> </strong></em><em>5)<strong> Multiple Roles and Possible Expansion:</strong></em> As stated above, the mission of AMPAC should not be limited to maritime patrol since even downgraded (demilitarized) P-3C aircraft would maintain optical sensors including Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) capability with profound communication links. There are many other potential uses for those capabilities in the area surrounding the South China Sea. In particular, the AHA Center, ASEAN’s coordinating center for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, could utilize such communication links in case of a natural disaster. Information sharing through air patrols in the South China Sea could also facilitate future antipiracy cooperation based on the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against ships in Asia, or the ReCAAP initiative. Taking into account the long operational radius of the P-3C aircraft, AMPAC should be open to participation by other countries in the region such as Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, and even Myanmar.

The AMPAC concept can be characterized by its (a) relatively low cost, (b) multilateral and transparent nature, (c) potential contributions not only to maritime patrol capabilities in the South China Sea but to many other regional issues, and (d) clear role for the U.S.-Japan alliance in terms of capacity building. However, AMPAC also presents many challenges that would necessitate close coordination between and within the governments of participating countries. For example, though the overall cost for Japan will not be so burdensome if you can exclude the purchase price of aircraft, necessary maintenance and downgrading costs for Japanese P-3Cs may discourage Japan from participating in this initiative. In addition, regional governments such as the Philippines and Vietnam would have to make some tough political decisions that would signify a tougher stance against China. Further, downgrading P-3C aircraft would require the United States to thoroughly examine various issues including International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), which basically require U.S. congressional approval for providing defense equipment to foreign countries.

Possible Chinese reactions to this concept should also be taken into consideration. For example, China might establish a new Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) over the South China Sea or dispatch the PLA air force to challenge AMPAC aircraft, increasing the risk of escalation. But as long as AMPAC remains a civilian concept, Chinese responses would presumably be limited and easier to manage by participating countries. However, a range of policy measures would have to be in place to account for responses to AMPAC that could be potentially destabilizing. The aforementioned guidelines for U.S.-Japan cooperation and defense policy reform measures in Japan currently being debated in the parliament will enable a much broader spectrum of regional security cooperation for these circumstances.

As the Center for Strategic and International Studies stipulates in its “Federated Defense” concept,<a name="_ftnref11"></a><a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> “at a time when the United States and many of its allies and partners are reluctant to increase defense and security spending, working together is of paramount importance.” The multinational nature of the AMPAC concept could make it a perfect manifestation of the “federated defense approach” and help “knit together an Asian security community that is searching for deeper regional integration.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In examining <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-18/u-s-navy-urges-joint-southeast-asia-patrols-of-south-china-sea">recent suggestions</a> for joint patrolling of the South China Sea, analysts have <a href="http://amti.csis.org/joint-patrols-and-u-s-coast-guard-capacity/">tended to focus</a> on the surface vessels of various nations’ coast guards and navies. Yet the flight of a U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAAahUKEwi5gt72sfnGAhUB7YAKHQ5KAK8&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2015%2F05%2F26%2Fpolitics%2Fsouth-china-sea-navy-surveillance-plane-jim-sciutto%2F&amp;ei=DSK1VfnHEoHagwSOlIH4Cg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEytOPrjbhj7HjzHOly3Zn7795isw&amp;sig2=h3ruYk7iaYsMdAAbI-vYcA&amp;bvm=bv.98717601,d.eXY">hosting a CNN film crew</a> over disputed waters in the South China Sea in May highlighted the potential of air power – specifically maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) – in executing the possible missions of joint patrols. To explore the potential effectiveness of South China Sea joint air patrols it is important to first be clear about the often overlooked distinctions in missions, locations, and concepts.

Proposed joint air patrol missions broadly fall into two categories. One seeks to counter excessive claims and rights not in accordance with international law (i.e. maritime freedom of navigation and overflight, or FON, operations). A second, exemplified by the <a href="http://oceansbeyondpiracy.org/matrix/malacca-strait-patrols">Eyes-in-the-Sky</a> (EiS) component of the Malacca Strait Patrol (MSP), is geared towards enhancing maritime domain awareness (MDA) and enforcement.

In addition to objectives, it is critical to understand the proposed operating areas. Dzirhan Mahadzir, a defense journalist based in Malaysia, notes “many forget that the South China Sea is a sprawling area. People got excited at May’s International Maritime Defense Exhibition (IMDEX) when the Republic of Singapore Navy Chief <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-malaysia-and/1838338.html">called for patrols in the South China Sea</a> to deter piracy, but he was referring to just a small zone off Johor and Singapore.”

Joint air patrols' locations can also present difficulties due to conflicting territorial claims and, to a lesser extent, whether the proposed area actually presents a cost-effective opportunity to undertake the professed MDA or FON mission, in case the real purpose of the joint patrols is deterrence or signaling directed at a third party.

In fact, many of the same challenges that encumber surface joint patrols, including lack of interoperability, capacity, political will, and information-sharing agreements apply to their prospective air counterparts. But an air approach also brings unique challenges.

The nature of air patrols increases the importance of the endurance and range of platforms, with the former measured in hours instead of the days or weeks of a surface patrol, and heightens the value of neighboring facilities – in this case airstrips – which extend time on station. One of the more interesting dichotomies is that concerned states not embroiled in South China Sea territorial disputes such as the United States, Japan, and Australia generally have greater MPA capabilities than claimant states, while claimant states naturally have the nearby air bases non-claimants lack.

The result has been a pairing of the two. It should be no surprise that like many U.S. P-8A patrols over the South China Sea, the flight in May took off from the Philippines’ Clark Air Base. Similarly, Royal Australian Air Force P-3C surveillance flights of the southern expanses of the South China Sea depart from Royal Malaysian Air Force Station Butterworth on the Malay Peninsula as part of the decades-long <a href="http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/UploadedFiles/General/Snippet_5.pdf">Operation <em>Gateway</em></a>. This arrangement however means that both the hosting and use of tenant capabilities – including joint patrols – are dependent on the host nation’s politics.

The symbiotic nature of participants in “unilateral” air patrols over the South China Sea illustrates a third nuance, that the essential ingredients required to cook up a “joint patrol” are open to interpretation. Start with participation. A classic joint air patrol involves two manned aircraft accompanying each other. However, Professor Alex Calvo of Nagoya University says an expansive definition could include the provision of emergency landing facilities, intelligence-sharing, embedded personnel, and ultimately manned planes – to which I would add aerial refueling and unmanned surveillance platforms. For instance, Operation <em>Gateway</em> could qualify as it is “a bilateral arrangement with Malaysia and involves sharing sortie data in exchange for access to facilities,” says Rear Adm. James Goldrick, Royal Australian Navy (Ret.), an adjunct professor at UNSW Canberra.

Further, Dzirhan notes that instead of the classic definition of joint patrols, EiS consists of “coordinated patrols, in which each country's aircraft patrol specific sectors within their own territory,” albeit carrying country liaison officers. In such MDA missions, the concentration of resources in joint patrols might actually be counterproductive. FON flights make a better case for joint air patrols due to the reinforcing symbolism of multiple nations registering their non-consent to a claim. It is therefore important to clarify whether a proposal is discussing traditional <em>joint</em> air patrols or <em>coordinated</em> air patrols.

After its collection, EiS and Malacca Strait Patrol information feeds a common operating picture for its participants at Singapore’s Information Fusion Centre (IFC). This points to a final distinction, between similarly comprehensive efforts requiring extensive support infrastructure and less frequent or one-off endeavors.

Although continued coverage is necessary for effective MDA and enforcement missions, infrequent symbolic flights suffice for FON operations from an international law standpoint – although they may not satisfy a desire to sustain pressure on violators of international norms. Infrequent patrols can also play an important role in partnership building. For instance, Japan in late June <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/06/joint-japan-philippine-flight-over-south-china-sea-riles-china/">conducted a joint air patrol</a> with the Philippines as part of a search and rescue exercise over waters claimed by China, during which a Japanese P-3C departed Palawan with Philippine crew members aboard and accompanying a Philippine aircraft.

<strong>A Coordinated Approach for South China Sea Patrols</strong>

With these distinctions in mind, a two-tiered approach appears practical for coordinated air patrols in the South China Sea aimed at enhancing MDA. The more capable MPA forces of the United States, Australia, and Japan, could form the basis of a first tier and initially focus their patrols above disputed exclusive economic zones (EEZs), including much of the Spratlys. “Information gained during these patrols could also be used for increasing transparency regarding current developments in the South China Sea,” says Scott Bentley, a PhD candidate at the Australian Defence Force Academy. A second tier could be formed of claimant states tasking forces, when available, to initiate patrols above their own EEZs – ameliorating some capacity issues – and providing liaison crew members and air facilities.

In addition to spearheading the MDA mission, first-tier forces could “proceed with traditional joint air patrols, actively contesting Chinese assertions of sovereignty” in excess of international law allowances, notes Calvo. “Japan <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/29/us-usa-japan-southchinasea-idUSKBN0NK15M20150429">has already discussed the issue publicly</a>. It would fit well with Japanese Prime Minister Abe’s narrative emphasizing the rule of law at sea, and make it easier to show both domestically and abroad that it is Beijing, not Tokyo, that is the ‘odd man out’.” While Australia might not propose the effort, Andrew Davies, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, says “I think if the U.S. pushed a little, Australia would be involved.” It would be important, however, for these joint patrols to occur independent of the coordinated patrol initiative so as not to scare away potential second tier participants wary of being seen as confronting China.

Davies points out that just as important as operational coordination is the “joint surveillance architecture and the ability to move data around with trusted partners.” Although this is largely in place between Japan and the U.S. and the U.S. and Australia, the MDA initiative would need to grow the connective tissue for sharing the collected surveillance data between the two tiers. Singapore’s role as an honest broker at the IFC for EiS/MSP could again serve as a model – or the IFC could itself be the means for MDA data dissemination. There, aerial patrol data feeds separate common operating pictures for each state, tailored to their participation in various initiatives.

This first-tier of participants generates challenges. “Singapore tends to largely stay out of regional issues and actions that it does not have a direct stake in,” says Dzirhan, so its participation might require extra effort and assurances the initiative is not “aimed” at China. For Japan, a sustained coordinated patrol effort would strain its MPA capacity in light of current requirements in the East China Sea. And determining who pays for the required overhead would be a major sticking point in any arrangement.

Future potential first-tier participants include Indonesia and India. The former advocated multilateral “<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-30/indonesia-urges-peace-patrols-with-china-in-south-china-sea-iaao1wmc">peace patrols</a>” in the region, while “a joint aerial patrol with like-minded nations would help India strengthen its image and establish a credible role for it as a security actor in the Asia-Pacific,” says Darshana Baruah, a junior fellow with the Observer Research Foundation.

But once again, it matters whether the coordinated air patrol initiative appears an effort to confront China. “It is unlikely that India will engage in such an effort straightway,” says Baruah. “New Delhi is still shedding off its Non-Aligned Movement policy and although we signed the Joint Strategic Vision with the U.S., a direct collaboration in countering Chinese actions in the South China Sea may not be on the cards for India.” Indonesia’s defense minister meanwhile suggested China’s inclusion in the peace patrols concept.

As such, China should have the same opportunity to participate in the cooperative air patrol initiative as other second-tier participants, but on the same conditions as the others. This is an opportunity for the U.S. to use the potential ruling at the Philippines’ Arbitral Court case against China's Nine-Dash Line as leverage. Participants in the initiative could be required to abide by all rulings of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague. As a result, either China abides by whatever the court rules or it turns down the initiative’s offer and in doing so allows the U.S. to simultaneously portray the initiative as “open to” China, bolstering the case for participation by non-confrontational partners, and highlight China as an actor unbound by international law.

Meanwhile the Philippines would be the most willing to participate in the second tier, while Malaysia, Vietnam, and Brunei could all potentially take part. In addition to providing valuable air facilities, several of these countries might soon field upgraded MPA capabilities. For instance, Philippines defense observer Armando Heredia says acquiring capable “long-range patrol aircraft is part of the current ‘horizon’ ending in 2017 of the <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/07/the-truth-about-philippine-military-modernization-and-the-china-threat/">Philippine’s Three Horizon defense plan</a>.<strong>”</strong> At the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/asia-pacific-countries-buy-surveillance-planes-to-outfox-rivals-1437715525">Trevor Moss says</a> Malaysia “was made aware of its weak maritime patrol capabilities by the <a href="http://news.usni.org/2013/03/06/borneo-violence-escalates">invasion of East Malaysia by Filipino militants in 2013</a> and the disappearance of Flight MH370 and subsequent search operations in 2014,” driving an “aim to buy six to eight surveillance aircraft in the near future.”

Initially limiting the initiative to air patrols would remove the complications stemming from law enforcement vessels in disputed EEZs and territorial waters, but likewise limit the potential of the common operating picture. At some point, participants might have to decide whether the sovereignty issues can be set aside or a creative solution agreed upon, such as limiting vessels tasked to the initiative to patrolling EEZs undisputed by any other EEZ, thereby side-stepping the complication on the Nine-Dash Line as long as it remains unclarified.

Another wrinkle would be the potential participation of Taiwan with its airstrip on Itu Aba and its P-3C aircraft. Taiwan’s participation would likely be opposed by China, but not necessarily so, if the initiative emphasized MDA for regional maritime security and a de-emphasized military dimensions. Regardless, an invitation to Taiwan, like the conditions for joining, might make the initiative a “poison pill” to China that yet appears reasonable enough to placate the concerns of non-confrontational Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, and Malaysia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[More than any country in the region, the Philippines has sought to protect its territorial integrity through “lawfare” (legal warfare), <a href="http://amti.csis.org/the-philippines-between-scylla-and-charybdis-at-the-hague/">taking China to the court</a> over maritime disputes in the South China Sea. Perturbed by China’s growing assertiveness across disputed waters, evident in its expanded para-military patrols, massive reclamation activities, and regular military drills in the area, the Philippines has also <a href="http://amti.csis.org/catch-up-in-manila-for-minimum-deterrence/">doubled down</a> on its military spending, hoping to modernize its armed forces.

Like never before, the disputes in the South China Sea have become a key topic in the Philippine national discourse.  According to a Pew survey, up to <a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/14/chapter-4-how-asians-view-each-other/">93% of Filipinos</a> are worried about the prospects of war in the South China Sea, with a clear majority (58%) viewing China as a national security threat. The Aquino administration has astutely tapped into growing nationalist sentiments at home, portraying Manila’s struggle against its northern neighbor in biblical ‘David vs. Goliath’ terms.

The Filipino president, Benigno Aquino, on at least two occasions, went <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jplehmann/2015/06/07/president-aquino-should-shut-up-on-south-china-sea-china-is-not-nazi-germany-the-philippines-has-other-priorities/">so far as to</a> liken China to Nazi Germany, repeatedly <a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/07/08/1474544/philippines-rejects-bilateral-talks-china-anew">dismissing diplomatic engagement</a> with China as a form of appeasement. Back in 2013 and 2014, more than 60% of the population supported Aquino’s approach to China, but recent  surveys, however, suggest that a growing portion of Filipinos <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/96873-filipinos-government-south-china-sea-sws">(46%)</a> are now skeptical about the efficacy of the government’s approach to China. Of particular concern is the inability of the Aquino administration to tangibly defend the Philippines’ claims on the ground, while China has managed to rapidly build a sprawling network of civilian and military bases across the Spratly chain of islands. Not only has the Philippines effectively lost the Scarborough Shoal since 2012, but there is a growing feeling that the government has fallen short of sufficiently fortifying its outposts and defending its position on the ground amid a protracted lawfare with China.

<strong>The Trailblazer </strong>

The Philippines, specifically under the Marcos dictatorship (1965-1986), was among the first countries to build an airstrip along with advanced military facilities in the South China Sea. Recognizing the Darwinian nature of the territorial struggles among half a dozen nations in the area, Manila <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/jurisdiction/?p1=5&amp;p2=1&amp;p3=3&amp;code=PH">shunned legal</a> arbitration in favor of a <em>de facto </em>exercise of sovereignty over disputed features in the Spratly chain of islands.

Confident of its military capabilities, and reassured by robust American military presence on its soil, the Marcos regime managed to exercise control over numerous features in the Spratly chain of islands, including the much-prized Thitu (<em>Pag-Asa</em>) Island, the second largest feature in the area. Thanks to its strategic foresight during Cold War, the Philippines enjoyed enormous tactical advantage relative to other claimant states in the area.

Soon, however, other claimant states began to replicate the Philippine strategy in the area, building their own airstrips and expanding their military presence in the area. Meanwhile, succeeding Filipino administration progressively neglected the imperative to maintain and upgrade fortifications on the ground. Shortly after the departure of American bases (1992), China opportunistically wrested control of the Philippine-claimed Mischief Reef, revealing the vulnerability of Manila’s position in the area.

Still, the Philippines continued to neglect the necessity to strengthen its position on the ground. As former Philippine national security adviser Roilo Golez told me, Filipino leaders continuously “ignored the strategic value of a string of rocks and reefs and shoals that are convertible into potent military stations to control the vast sea around.”

<strong>Catch up Time </strong>

The Philippines’ rusty, dilapidated outpost in the Second Thomas Shoal painfully reveals the lopsided nature of the country’s South China Sea strategy. Since 1999, the Philippines has grounded a World War II relic, the <em>Sierra Madre</em> tank-landing vessel, in order to assert its claim over the disputed reef.

Over the past 16 years, the <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2014/07/world/south-china-sea-dispute/">ragtag outpost</a> has hosted, on a rotational basis, a small contingent of Filipino troops, who have had to withstand hunger, numbing solitude, violent weather conditions, scorching heat, and <a href="http://www.jamestown.org/programs/chinabrief/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=41054&amp;cHash=a7d10c92688430f1274bb09b95b18bcf">intensified Chinese harassment</a>.

Since 2013, Chinese Coast Guard vessels, some of them reported to be better-equipped than the Philippines conventional naval forces, have tried to lay siege on <em>Sierra Madre </em>and choke off its supply lines. The Philippines was only able to break a Chinese-led siege when its forces were accompanied by <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/83c0b88e-0732-11e4-81c6-00144feab7de.html">Pentagon’s P-8A surveillance</a> planes. Despite the growing threat posed by China, the Aquino administration still prevaricated on strengthening its position on the ground, instead <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-fog-law-chinas-great-south-china-sea-dilemma-11889">opting for</a> a legal confrontation.

In late-2014, the Philippine government <a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/112042/philippines-suspends-work-on-south-china-sea-military-airstrip/">decided to postpone</a> the refurbishment of its decades-old, emaciated facilities on the Thitu Island, which once stood as the shining example of Manila’s strategic acumen. Top Filipino defense officials tried to justify the astonishing decision by emphasizing the (supposed) importance of maintaining “the moral high ground” amid the Philippines’ ongoing arbitration case against China. Possibly, Manila also calculated that a legal approach is relatively anodyne compared to fortifying its position on the ground, though China has also vociferously opposed the arbitration proceedings.

Yet, maintenance and refurbishment of existing facilities constitutes a resumption of normal activities, which is consistent with international law. It is the artificial alteration of the nature of disputed features, as China has been doing for the past two years that violates international law. In short, the Philippines decided, quite naively, to put its eggs in the legal basket at the expense of the imperative to urgently strengthen its position on the ground.

Meanwhile, <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/david-vs-goliath-the-south-china-sea-the-philippines-vs-11534">other claimant states</a>, from China to Taiwan and Vietnam, rapidly enhanced their position on the ground. Taipei embarked on a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/25/taiwan-southchinasea-idUSL3N0O70AV20140525">$100 million project to upgrade its port</a> facilities on the already well-maintained Itu Aba (<em>Tai Ping</em> to Taiwanese), the biggest feature in the contested area. This would allow Taiwan to accommodate heavy naval frigates and coast guard cutters. Airstrip facilities have also been upgraded to accommodate Hercules C-130 transport planes.

As for <a href="http://amti.csis.org/chinas-land-reclamation-announcement-a-change-in-message-not-in-policy/">China</a> and <a href="http://amti.csis.org/amti-issue-15/">Vietnam</a>, they engaged in reclamation activities, artificially expanding rocks and atolls under their control in order to more effectively project power. Recognizing the folly of its strategic negligence in the area, the Philippines<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/14/us-southchinasea-philippines-shoal-exclu-idUSKCN0PN2HN20150714"> has finally decided</a> to upgrade its facilities, particularly on the <em>Sierra Madre</em>. But as China gradually builds the skeleton of Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), the Philippines will have a lot of catching up to do.

While the government has made <a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/06/29/1471226/philippines-stops-repairs-pag-asa-island">halting steps</a> in repairing its facilities on Thitu Island, particularly its cracking airstrip, it has also proceeded with reinforcing the deck and hull of and installing ventilation systems on the rusty <em>Sierra Madre </em>in the Second Thomas Shoal. Nonetheless, Manila seems still hesitant to make any significant overhaul of its outposts due to, officially, its concern over its moral high ground and commitment to “rules-based diplomatic approach.” In all likelihood, Manila’s hesitance is also due to difficulties and risks associated with making major upgrades, as these may provoke China into menacing response.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Case for Japan’s Patrol in the South China Sea</title>
		<link>http://amti.csis.org/the-case-for-japans-patrol-in-the-south-china-sea/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the past few months, speculation about possible Japanese patrols in the South China Sea has attracted media attention. The United States’ 7<sup>th</sup> Fleet Commander welcomed such patrol by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF), while Japan’s defense minister and top uniform officer responded cautiously but positively.

Japan renounced all of its claims in the South China Sea under the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty and takes no sides on territorial disputes among claimant states. However, Japan has a strong stake in the South China Sea as the disputed waters are part of Japan’s critical sea lines of communication. Japan has been engaged in the South China Sea issues primary through capacity building for claimants such as the Philippines and Vietnam so that they can maintain good order at sea. It will, however, take years before the capacity building programs make a difference.

There are urgent needs for JMSDF to join the U.S. Navy for aerial patrol in the South China Sea. Due to budgetary constraints, South China Sea patrols are a huge burden for the U.S. Navy, and Chinese maritime activities there, including the artificial islands construction, are increasingly intensive. The JMSDF can contribute a lot to enhanced maritime domain awareness (MDA) in the South China Sea.

China’s land reclamation makes little military sense unless China also reclaims the Scarborough Shoal, which China took from the Philippines in 2012. The seven artificial Islands on the Spratly Islands and the Woody Island in the Parcel Islands do not, by themselves, give China sufficient operational coverage over the entire Nine-Dash Line claim. Enhanced MDA among claimants is essential to prevent China from reclaiming the Scarborough Shoal, which lies near the Philippines’ Subic Bay.

Japan also has an interest in freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. China’s land reclamation in the Spratly Islands has little legal ground, and artificial islands should not produce 12 nautical miles territorial waters. The United States has not decided to conduct its operational assertions inside Chinese-claimed territorial waters under the Freedom of Navigation Program, but Japan should encourage Washington to do so by expressing its will to jointly conduct operational assertions.

China’s ongoing strategic nuclear submarine (SSBN) program in the South China Sea is another reason. Pentagon’s annual report on Chinese military power expects China’s Jin-class SSBNs will start their patrol with longer range ballistic missile JL-2 shortly. China’s new SSBNs will not change strategic landscape immediately, but Japan needs to join US strategic anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations to maintain the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence.

Despite those urgent needs and its sophisticated surveillance capability, it is unlikely that JMSDF will start regular patrols in the South China Sea due to lack of capacity. JMSDF P-3Cs based in Naha are very busy with the patrol in the East China Sea, where Chinese ships challenge Japanese sovereignty over the Senkaku Islands and Chinese oil companies build gas platforms, possibly with military installations. JMSDF also dispatches two P-3Cs to the Gulf of Aden for counter-piracy patrols every six months.

In the short term, JMSDF is able to conduct occasional patrols, when P-3Cs rotate between Japan and the Gulf of Aden or when it conducts combined training and exercises with the Philippine Navy and U.S. Navy. Additionally, Japan is able to assume the U.S. Navy’s patrol missions in the East China Sea and share intelligence under the new U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation Guidelines so that the U.S. Navy can concentrate its patrol in the South China Sea.

In the longer term, the JMSDF will have enhanced surveillance capabilities as it currently plans to replace 80 P-3Cs with 70 P-1s indigenous next generation patrol aircraft. But to conduct regular patrol in the South China Sea, the JMSDF needs to procure additional P-1s. The JMSDF also needs to obtain access to support or emergency facilities in the South China Sea. Accordingly, the JMSDF may seek a visiting forces agreement with the Philippines. In addition, the Japanese government can use its official development assistance strategically to invest into commercial airport infrastructure construction along the South China Sea.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On July 22, 2015, the Government of Japan (GOJ) released photographs<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> and a map<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> of offshore drilling platforms constructed by China in the East China Sea and issued a statement<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> calling on China to cease what Japan considers unilateral resource development in violation of a bilateral agreement concerning the joint exploration of natural resources.  The Foreign Ministry statement was preceded by the release of a new defense white paper denouncing the construction activities<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>, as well as comments by Defense Minister Gen Nakatani suggesting the platforms could be used to station radar or conduct air patrols in the East China Sea.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>  China’s Foreign Ministry dismissed Japan’s demands as groundless and declared its oil and gas development in the East China Sea “fully justified and legitimate.”<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>  Both governments referenced dialogue to address this issue but the dispute is emblematic of tensions in Japan-China relations that render the prospects for a diplomatic resolution uncertain.

In May 2008 President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda issued a joint statement including a section on economic cooperation indicating a shared resolve to make the East China Sea “a Sea of Peace, Cooperation and Friendship.”<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> A month later then Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura announced an initial agreement aimed at joint development of natural resources in the East China Sea with details such as the maritime boundary between their exclusive economic zones (EEZ) to be finalized in bilateral negotiations.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>  Specifically, Komura stated that the two countries would “undertake joint development in the northern part of the East China Sea and on the Chinese side of the median line at Shirakaba” oil and gas field, and that Japanese corporations would participate in areas China had already begun to develop.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>  Consultations on the agreement were conducted in 2010 but have not taken place since, due ostensibly to tensions aroused by competing claims over the territorial sovereignty of the Senkaku islands (Diaoyu in China).  The lack of an agreement on EEZ boundaries—China does not recognize the “median line” Japan has drawn as a marker of geographical equidistance between the two countries—and details for joint development could further complicate bilateral ties.

The GOJ identified 16 structures China has built or begun to develop in the East China Sea, 12 since June 2013, and expressed concern with the accelerated pace at which China appears to be pursuing resource extraction.  The map released by the GOJ plots 14 locations and all are on the Chinese side of the median line, but the GOJ statement notes that China should refrain from unilateral development because the EEZ and continental shelf in the East China Sea has not yet been “delimited” and requests that China resume negotiations with Japan pursuant to the 2008 agreement.  Three of the structures including the aforementioned Shirakaba facility are near the median line and have prompted concerns that China could siphon gas from areas technically claimed by Japan.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>  China’s Foreign Ministry issued its own statement claiming a 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone and a continental shelf in the East China Sea extending to the Okinawa Trough, asserting that its gas exploration activities are carried out in undisputed waters under China’s jurisdiction, and rejecting Japan’s position that the EEZ should be delimited on the basis of the median line.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>  But China also left the door open for dialogue with Japan on implementing the 2008 agreement.

The drivers of this impasse over gas exploration are multifaceted and not easily resolved.  Japan and China have differing interpretations of territorial sovereignty with respect to the EEZ in the East China Sea and five years have passed since the last attempt to build on the 2008 preliminary agreement.  China has pursued unilateral resource development it believes is legitimate and consistent with its sovereignty claims, but which Japan considers an attempt to alter the status quo.  And the rapid pace of China’s land reclamation activities in the South China Sea and the potential to develop military platforms there has generated suspicion in Japan about ulterior motives in developing oil and gas platforms in the East China Sea.  Reports that Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi could meet later this week in Malaysia on the margins of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ministerial suggest potential for bilateral diplomacy to manage tensions.  But if the degree of mistrust evident in the recent airing of differences over resource development is any indication, the path to establishing a sea of peace, cooperation and friendship will remain elusive.

		<title>Beijing’s Assurances Unpersuasive: A COC Can’t Wait</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At regional meetings in Kuala Lumpur this week, China attempted to reassure regional nations of its peaceful intentions and deflect attention from its destabilizing activities in the Spratly Island chain in the South China Sea. Speaking to reporters, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that Beijing had halted dredging sand to build artificial islands. “China has already stopped. You just take an airplane to take a look,” he maintained.

But Wang said nothing about ongoing construction and militarization of several land features. A 10,000-foot runway is nearly complete on Fiery Cross Reef, and according to Pacific Commander Harry Harris, the Chinese appear to be building hangars for tactical fighters. Satellite imagery also suggests that China may be getting ready to build a second runway on nearby Subi Reef. Early warning radar stations, military barracks, helipads, and lookout towers have been installed on several features and harbors large enough to receive tankers and major surface combatants are being built.

Wang Yi’s remarks were timed to coincide with a series of high level meetings in Malaysia this week led by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), including the ASEAN Regional Forum and the East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in which the United States participates. Pressure has been building on China to exercise self-restraint and engage in purposeful dialogue aimed at lowering tensions in the South China Sea.

At the Shangri-La Dialogue in June, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter called for an “immediate and lasting halt to land reclamation by all claimants” and a halt to “further militarization of dispute features.” Earlier this week, ASEAN Secretary-General Le Luong Minh criticized Beijing for “eroding the very trust and confidence . . . between ASEAN and China” through its “reclamation activities, illegal fishing bans and the harassment of fishermen.”

Despite Chinese insistence that ASEAN should not discuss the territorial disputes at the annual ASEAN Foreign Minister’s Meeting this week, which is attended by 10 Southeast Asian nations that comprise the organization, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, host of this year’s series of meetings, said publicly that it was time for ASEAN to “take a more active role” in managing “overlapping claims” and safeguarding regional security.

Sensing the rising angst in the region about its island building in the South China Sea, in the run-up to the meetings this week China attempted to signal a willingness to work with regional players by agreeing to establish hotlines among foreign ministries to respond to maritime emergencies. The efficacy of such hotlines is dubious, however, since coast guards, navies, and maritime militias are not administered by foreign ministries. Moreover, China’s foreign ministry is known to be institutionally weak and is rarely put in charge of handling crises. A maritime rights leading group headed by Xi Jinping is far more powerful.

More importantly, what is urgently needed is a binding Code of Conduct (CoC) to replace the voluntary 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DoC). In talks between China and ASEAN this week, Beijing agreed again to speed up consultations on a CoC, but in practice it is unlikely to do so, at least until it has completed its near-term plan, which may include establishing an Air Defense Identification Zone in the South China Sea and creating the infrastructure to enforce it.

China appears to be increasingly uncomfortable with the growing chorus reproving Chinese activities in the South China Sea. Beijing’s agreement this week to establish hotlines and quicken the pace of CoC discussions suggests that the Chinese recognize that their behavior is causing greater anxiety amongst their neighbors than they anticipated. So far, however, the pushback has not been sufficient to change China’s calculus, which is that in the long term, Southeast Asian nations will be compelled to accommodate to Chinese interests in the South China Sea. Therefore, greater efforts are needed to persuade China to adopt a more compromising approach that truly emphasizes peaceful management of disputes and respects the interests of all the players regardless of size and military capabilities. To achieve this goal, ASEAN must demand conclusion of a binding CoC before the end of 2015 that contains risk-reduction measures and a dispute settlement mechanism. If China is unwilling to do so, ASEAN, or a sub-group of like-minded members, should proceed unilaterally. The US should do its utmost to help forge this consensus.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>August 1945: A Snapshot of American Maritime Strategy in the Pacific</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When Japan surrendered 70 years ago this month, the United States stood supreme in the Pacific.  Only the Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy had surface combatants that could roam freely from the Indian Ocean to the East China Sea and these remained a fraction of the massive “Big Blue Fleet” the U.S. Navy had deployed.  With the exception of Taiwan, parts of the Dutch East Indies, the Japanese archipelago and a smattering of isolated South Pacific atolls, the entire offshore island chain in the Western Pacific was under the control of the United States and its allies.

<a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/14.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3805" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/14-1024x780.jpg" alt="14" width="640" height="488" /></a>

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Areas under Allied and Japanese Control. August 15, 1945.</strong></p>
Continental Asia was another matter.  U.S. and Commonwealth forces had advanced across Burma, but Manchuria and the northern part of the Korean peninsula were under the control of Soviet forces.  The U.S. government would rush battle-hardened veterans from Okinawa to occupy the southern part of the Korean peninsula and leave the vast expanse from Mandalay to Hanoi under Lord Louis Mountbatten’s South East Asia Command (SEAC-- which American officers derided as the “Save England’s Asian Colonies” command).  In the next two decades this weak purchase on the mainland would cost over 100,000 American lives in Korea and Vietnam as policymakers debated how far to invest in the security of  Continental Asia.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Allied_battleships_in_Sagami_Bay_28_Aug_1945.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3813" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Allied_battleships_in_Sagami_Bay_28_Aug_1945-1024x757.jpg" alt="Allied_battleships_in_Sagami_Bay_28_Aug_1945" width="640" height="473" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Allied battleships in Sagami Bay. August 28, 1945.</strong></p>
With respect to maritime Asia, however, there was little debate.  As Chief of Naval Operations Ernest King told the press on July 24, 1943:
<blockquote>…after this war, whether we are criticized for imperialism or not, we have got to take and run the Mandated Islands, and perhaps even the Solomons. We have got to dominate the Pacific.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a></blockquote>
King spoke for the entire naval establishment and the majority of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s senior advisors.  After fighting a bloody island hopping campaign across the Central and Southwest Pacific, there was broad consensus that America’s post-war defense line had to lie on the offshore island chains and not Hawaii or the West Coast.  As early as 1943, Navy Secretary Frank Knox ordered a review of which air and naval bases the United States would need in the Western Pacific after the war.  The U.S. Army Air Force, which had used offshore islands to such devastating effect against Japan, also came to appreciate that opponents with strong air forces did not necessarily need a large navy to threaten U.S. interests in the Pacific if they had access to air bases on the islands. Roosevelt’s closest advisor, Harry Hopkins, had confided to General Joe Stilwell that after the war the United States must have strong bases in Formosa, the Philippines, “and anywhere we damn please.”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a>  The President’s liaison to the Chiefs of staff, Admiral William Leahy, told the President that it was critical for the United States to hold all the islands taken in the Pacific as permanent bases and not to turn them over to the UN.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a>  And in July 1945 Knox’s successor, James Forrestal explained in testimony before a joint session of the Senate and House Committees on Naval Affairs in July 1945, the United States had to seek naval superiority in pivotal areas, including “the waters contiguous to Japan and to the Philippines<em>.</em>”<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a>

Roosevelt was an avid student of Alfred Thayer Mahan and a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy and understood the inherent importance of the offshore island chain to the security of the Pacific and the United States itself.  But FDR was also an anti-imperialist and a fervent believer in a new collective security order centered on the “Four Policemen” of Britain, China, Russia and the United States.  He mused throughout the war that the offshore island chain could host bombers to keep an eye on Japan and maintain stability after the fighting stopped.  The offshore islands were critical, he concurred, but within the context of collective security.  To the dismay of key advisors, Roosevelt turned the Kuriles over to Stalin at Yalta and agreed to put the former German colonies in the South Pacific under UN Trusteeship as a way to prod the French and British to do the same with their former colonies.  JCS planners, who had studied taking the Kuriles to bomb Japan, warned that the islands were “the obvious springboard of the most possible route of attack on us” by Soviet forces after the war, but they could not sway President Harry S. Truman from fulfilling Roosevelt’s plans in the final allied summit at Potsdam on 18 July 1945.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a>

Over the next five years, the Navy lost political momentum in the rush to demobilize after the war.  By 1950 the Big Blue Fleet was reduced to a small fraction of its former strength, with only one carrier, two destroyer divisions, three submarines, and a pair of auxiliary ships.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup></a>  Secretary of State Dean Acheson famously excluded Korea from the American defense line in his January 1950 National Press Club speech.  That June, the North attacked the South.  Truman’s first reaction on hearing the news, was to ask about the threat to Japan and the offshore island chain.  The vision of offshore island control advanced by King, Knox, Forrestal, Hopkins and Leahy now became the centerpiece of U.S. strategy in the Pacific.  And though rarely stated as such, remains the centerpiece today.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the early hours of 4 February 1945 two Australian commandos, Alex Chew and Bill Jinkins, paddled away from an American submarine, the USS <em>Pargo</em>, and landed on Woody Island in the Paracels. In the weeks beforehand, American airmen had reported seeing a French tricolour flying on the island and ‘Z Force’ had been tasked to investigate. Chew and Jinkins discovered there were indeed French people on the island but also Japanese sailors and so retreated to the sub. The <em>Pargo</em> surfaced and shelled the buildings for several minutes. The first ‘Battle of the Paracels’ was a one-sided affair.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>

A separate mission to Japanese-occupied Itu Aba a month earlier hadn’t been so successful. Two other Australian commandos, launched from the USS <em>Bream</em>, had been unable to plant their explosives and retreated. Instead the island was hit from the air. On 1 May 1945 American planes tested out a new weapon – napalm – and found it to be ‘most effective’ against the Japanese huts.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Just to make sure, B-25s bombed Itu Aba six times in one week in mid-July.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> There can hardly have been anything left standing.

<a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ItuAbaNapalm1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3816" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ItuAbaNapalm1.jpg" alt="ItuAbaNapalm1" width="279" height="271" /></a>

We don’t know exactly when the Japanese abandoned Itu Aba but it was sometime before the arrival of a US reconnaissance mission on 21 November 1945.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> Exactly when the Japanese left Woody and Pattle islands in the Paracels is equally unclear. American planes bombed them in March and April 1945.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> One Chinese newspaper account from 1947 suggested a US warship visited Woody Island in November 1945.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> Some have claimed that American ships transported Chinese officials to the islands to accept the Japanese surrender but, so far, no-one has been able to provide this author with evidence. The same 1947 Chinese newspaper tells us that on 12 December 1945, two members from the staff of the Bureau of Meteorology of Taiwan province (one of them Japanese) paid a brief visit to Woody Island and erected a stone tablet there.

The United States had wanted the fate of the islands to be decided by the United Nations. That was the first recommendation of a policy document, CAC-301, prepared in December 1944 ahead of the Yalta Conference.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> The earlier Cairo Conference, in November 1943 had called for Japanese-occupied “Manchuria, Formosa, and The Pescadores” to be returned to China. However the fate of “all other territories which [Japan] has taken by violence and greed” was left vague. It said nothing about who they should be assigned to after the war – leaving the French and Chinese to slug it out.

For about a year though, from late 1945 until late 1946, calm prevailed in the South China Sea. None of the features was occupied by any government. The French were too busy attempting to retake control of Indochina, the Philippines was still a US colony and the British and Americans regarded the reefs and rocks as little more than a danger to shipping. The Republic of China Navy (and before it, that of the Qing Dynasty) had never had the capacity to project power more than a couple of miles offshore and had been all but destroyed following the Japanese invasion in 1937. A 1947 US naval intelligence report noted, somewhat acidly, that, “from 1938 to 1945, the Chinese maintained a navy without ships”.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>

The serenity did not last. During the war the British and then the US navies had begun training up Chinese naval crews. In spring 1945 Washington approved the transfer of two destroyers, four minesweepers and two patrol craft to the ROC. The ships were sent to Miami for refitting where they were joined by over a thousand Chinese sailors. In the late spring of 1946, those trained crews sailed the ships back to China.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> There they joined a former British corvette HMS <em>Petunia</em> which, in January 1946, had become the ROC Ship <em>Fubo</em>.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>

In May 1946 a French ship inspected the Paracel Islands, visiting Pattle Island on the 26<sup>th</sup>, to reassert France’s pre-war claim to the islands. The navy report tells us that the French didn’t know what had caused the wartime destruction to the island.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> Presumably the Americans hadn’t told them. Then, on 23 July (shortly after the Philippines became formally independent from the US) the Philippine Vice-President Elpido Quirino issued a declaration claiming the Spratly Islands.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><sup><sup>[12]</sup></sup></a> In response, the RoC government began to take practical steps to assert its own claim.

Research by a Canadian postgraduate researcher, Chris Chung, has shed new light on what happened.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><sup><sup>[13]</sup></sup></a> In 1946 the RoC Ministry of the Interior commissioned a ‘Location Sketch Map of the South China Sea Islands’ (Nanhai Zhudao Weizhi Lüetu南海諸島位置略圖). The resulting map included an 8-dash line stretching around the Sea and as far south as the James Shoal, just off the coast of Borneo. At this time, it appears the RoC believed the shoal was an island. In 1935 an RoC committee had translated its name as Zeng-mu (the transliteration of James) ‘Tan’ – where Tan means a sandbank. It was only in December 1947 that the cartographers realized their mistake and borrowed the literary word ‘Ansha’ to use as an equivalent to ‘shoal’.

<a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1946-RoC-Interior-Ministry-Sketch-map.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3815" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1946-RoC-Interior-Ministry-Sketch-map-669x1024.jpg" alt="1946 RoC Interior Ministry Sketch map" width="640" height="980" /></a>

The line the cartographer drew, incorporating this non-existent island and vast areas of sea, remains with us to this day. I have argued elsewhere that the shape of the line is a legacy of a series of ‘maps of national humiliation’ drawn by Chinese nationalists in the first half of the twentieth century.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> As such it owes more to those nationalists’ misunderstandings about Southeast Asian history than it does to any real assertion of historic Chinese sovereignty. It’s a mistake now being forced upon the region with ideological rigour.

At a meeting on 26 September 1946, representatives of the RoC ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Interior plus the Naval Headquarters ironed out details of China’s claim in the Sea. They agreed to follow the line drawn on the Interior Ministry’s map. They then resolved that, once the Executive Yuan had approved, the Guangdong provincial government would be put in charge of an operation to physically occupy the islands.

French diplomats heard rumours about the Chinese plans and the Paris government urged the colonial authorities in Indochina to get there first. A French minesweeper, the FR <em>Chevreuil</em> reached Itu Aba on 5 October 1946.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> A landing party deposited a marker stone renewing France's original annexation of the island (and five others) first publicized on 25 July 1933 (and about which China never protested<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>).<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> However, the High Commissioner of Indochina, Georges Thierry d’Argenlieu, was less concerned about the Paracels, preferring to deploy his forces against Ho Chi Minh’s Vietnamese nationalist movement instead.

By November 1946, the RoC navy included 41 older Chinese ships plus 82 transferred from the US and 9 from the UK.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> The vast majority were small patrol boats and landing craft but a few were large enough to make the journey to the archipelagos. The historian Ulises Granados tells us that a flotilla arrived in Yulin harbour on Hainan Island on 8 November 1946.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> Bad weather delayed the expeditions but after it passed, one group of ships, including the minesweeper <em>Yongxing</em> (formerly the USS <em>Embattle</em>) and the <em>Zhongjian</em> (formerly LST-716) and the <em>Fubo, </em>sailed to Woody Island in the Paracels, arriving on 24 November. Another, including the <em>Taiping</em> (formerly the USS Decker) and <em>Zhongye</em> (formerly LST-1056) sailed to Itu Aba, arriving on 12 December. For the first time in recorded history, a Chinese official set foot on one of the Spratly islands.

<a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/USS-Decker-1940s.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3817" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/USS-Decker-1940s.jpg" alt="USS Decker 1940s" width="720" height="343" /></a>

The French had got to Itu Aba first but they came second in the race to Woody Island. On 8 January 1947, a Chinese government spokesman announced the landing there and two days later the French sent a plane to check. When it reported that a Chinese unit was indeed in occupation, the French sent a ship, the <em>Tonkinois</em>, to try and force them to leave. Despite offers of money and even some firing in the air, the mission failed and the French retreated to Pattle Island instead.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a> A French, and later a Vietnamese, garrison would remain on Pattle Island until the Chinese invaded in 1974 – the ‘second battle of the Paracels’. The RoC garrison departed Woody Island in May 1950 after the communists occupied Hainan. PRC forces would arrive in 1955.

Although France had a much stronger claim to Itu Aba than China – by virtue of the 1933 annexation (and the RoC’s decision not to object) and its 1946 voyage – it failed to defend its position, and the RoC installed an occasional presence there. It too was evacuated in 1950 but Taiwanese forces were to return in 1956 and remain there, off and on, until today.

There are great ironies here. Firstly, the current Chinese names for Itu Aba Island – <em>Taiping Dao </em>– and Woody Island – <em>Yongxin Dao </em>– honour former American warships. Secondly, if the United States hadn't supplied those warships, China would today have a much-reduced claim in the Paracels and probably no claim at all in the Spratlys.

What does this complex history mean for the various legal claims to the islands? It's clear that France annexed and occupied six of the Spratlys well before China or any other country (except the UK, but we'll ignore that here). However it did almost nothing to uphold its claim to them in the decades after it granted independence to Vietnam. If we take France (and Britain) out of the picture then the evidence we have at the moment would suggest ‘China’ has the strongest claim to Itu Aba. (However, given that the island is occupied by Taiwan, there's a separate argument about which ‘China’ it is.)

But does that claim to Itu Aba give China rights over the rest of the Spratlys? Itu Aba is the largest of several features on the Tizard Bank, an area of raised seabed. However, since the early 1970s Vietnam has occupied Namyit Island – across the lagoon. Would a valid claim to Itu Aba give China a superior claim to the other features on the Bank too? Or should each feature be treated separately?

The question is multiplied when other features in the Spratlys are considered. All are separated from Tizard Bank – and most from one another – by deep sea. Would a claim to Itu Aba extend to other features too? Chinese officials have never occupied, administered or even stood on the vast majority of these islands, reefs and rocks so it seems unlikely that an international tribunal would regard the Chinese claim as superior to those of the other claimants.

This insight leads us towards a possible solution to the territorial disputes. In almost every case the current occupiers of each rock and reef in the Spratlys are the same countries whose forces first landed on them in the decades after the Second World War. They can easily prove continuous occupation since then. The Southeast Asian claimants (Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam) have come to an unwritten understanding that they will not seek to physically challenge the others’ claims. Could the same understanding be extended to China?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Second World War was an unparalleled calamity for the Soviet Union. As many as 27 million Soviet soldiers and civilians died as a result of the conflict that started with the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 and ended with the Japanese surrender in August 1945.

Consumed by this existential struggle along its western border, the Soviet Union was a comparatively minor factor in the Pacific War until the very end. Yet Moscow’s timely intervention in the war against Japan allowed it to expand its influence along the Pacific Rim.

With the breakdown of Allied unity soon heralding the onset of the Cold War, Soviet gains in Asia also left a legacy of division and confrontation, some of which endure into the present.

By the 1930s, Stalin’s Soviet Union and Imperial Japan both viewed themselves as rising powers with ambitions to extend their territorial holdings. In addition to a strategic rivalry dating back to the 19<sup>th</sup> century, they now nursed an ideological enmity born of the Bolshevik Revolution and the ultraconservative military’s growing hold on Japanese politics. In 1935, Japan signed the Anticomintern Pact with Hitler’s Germany, laying the foundation for the creation of the Axis (Fascist Italy would join the following year).

The two militaries engaged in a series of skirmishes along the frontier between Soviet Siberia and Japanese-occupied Manchuria (Manchukuo) during the late 1930s. The largest, at Khalkin Gol in the summer of 1939, left more than 17,000 dead. Yet worried by growing tensions in Europe and Southeast Asia, both Moscow and Tokyo recognized that their respective ambitions in Manchuria were not worth the mounting costs and soon turned their attention to other theaters.

Just two days after the German Wehrmacht launched Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, Moscow and Tokyo signed a non-aggression pact. Freed from the danger of a two-front war, the Soviet Union was able to focus all its resources on resisting the German onslaught. The Red Army consequently played virtually no role in the Pacific war that was soon raging, at least until the very end.

While recognizing that Moscow had no resources to spare as long as its troops were tied down in Europe, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt nonetheless sought to enlist Soviet assistance in the war against Japan once Germany had been defeated. Soviet leader Josef Stalin agreed, aiming to expand Soviet borders in Asia. Stalin began building up Soviet forces in the Far East once the tide of the war in Europe had turned following the Battle of Stalingrad.

At the February 1945 Yalta Conference, Stalin agreed that the Soviet Union would enter the war against Japan three months after Germany’s surrender. The Yalta declaration gave Moscow back southern Sakhalin and the Kurile Islands, which Japan had seized during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904-05. Mongolia was also to be recognized as an independent state (it was already a Soviet client), and Soviet interests in the naval base at the Chinese port of Port Arthur (Dalian) and the Manchurian railway that it had controlled before 1905 were to be respected.

Moscow subsequently declared war on Tokyo on August 8, 1945, two days after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and one day before the second bomb fell on Nagasaki (though Western historiography has long emphasized the role of the nuclear attacks in compelling Japan’s surrender, newly available Japanese documents emphasize the importance of the Soviet declaration of war in forcing Tokyo’s hand).

A massive invasion of Manchuria began the day after the Soviet declaration of war. Soviet forces also conducted amphibious landings along Japan’s colonial periphery: Japan’s Northern Territories, on Sakhalin Island, and in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula.

Washington and Moscow had agreed in advance to set up a joint trusteeship in Korea with an eye towards establishing Korea, under Japanese colonial rule since 1910, as an independent state. As in Europe, the U.S. and Soviet Union each received an occupation zone, on either side of the 38<sup>th</sup> parallel. Unable to reach an agreement on a government for both zones, the U.S. and Soviet trustees presided over the establishment of competing Korean governments for the north (Pyongyang) and south (Seoul). The stage was set for the Korean War, which broke out in January 1950 when North Korean forces poured across the 38<sup>th</sup> parallel, by then an international border.

The Soviet landings in Sakhalin faced significant Japanese resistance, but gradually succeeded in consolidating control over the entire island. Until 1945, Sakhalin was usually divided between a Russian zone in the north and a Japanese zone in the south. Russia and Japan had struggled over this large, sparsely populated island for more than a century, with the 1855 Treaty of Shimoda specifying that Russians could live in the north of the island and Japanese in the south. Japan relinquished its claims in 1875, but then seized the island during the Russo-Japanese War before returning the northern half to Moscow’s control in 1925. With the Treaty of San Francisco, which formally ended the war in the Pacific, Japan ceded all claims to Sakhalin, leaving the island under Soviet control even though Moscow had declined to sign the treaty.

The Soviet refusal to sign was more problematic with regard to a group of small islands northeast of Hokkaido and southwest of Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula: Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan, and Habomai. These islands had also been subject of a Russo-Japanese quarrel dating back to the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Moscow regarded these islands as the southernmost part of the Kurile chain, which Japan had renounced at San Francisco. The treaty neither specified, however, which islands belonged to the Kurile chain, nor recognized Soviet control over them. Japan, backed up by the U.S. argued that the four islands do not belong to the Kuriles, and that the USSR was illegally occupying them.

The dispute over these islands has prevented an agreement formally ending hostilities between Japan and Russia (as the USSR’s legal successor) up to the present. The issue is highly sensitive to nationalist factions in both Moscow and Tokyo, despite periodic efforts by diplomats on both sides to reach an agreement.

With both Russia and Japan increasingly wary of Chinese power in the Asia-Pacific, four sparsely populated outposts at the edge of the Sea of Okhotsk remain in many ways the biggest impediment to a rapprochement between Moscow and Tokyo that could reshape Asian geopolitics.

Meanwhile, the division of Korea has already sparked one major war, along with and untold suffering inside totalitarian North Korea. With 30,000 American troops still stationed in South Korea across the DMZ from an increasingly paranoid, nuclear armed North Korea, the Korean Peninsula remains one of the world’s most dangerous flashpoints.

Stalin’s intervention in the war against Japan came late in the day, but in many ways it continues shaping the Asian security environment six decades later.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[AMTI has asked some of its favorite maritime strategists—BJ Armstrong, Scott Cheney-Peters, James Holmes, Peter Mattis, and Bryan McGrath— to weigh in on the Pentagon’s new Asia-Pacific Maritime Security Strategy for Asia. What does the report contribute to existing US national security strategy, and does it meet the mandate set out in the NDAA? What would each author’s favorite maritime strategist have to say about the document? Our strategists weigh in below.

For details on the report itself, check out <a href="/anatomy-of-a-strategy/" target="_blank">Anatomy of a Strategy</a>, and you can read the full Asia-Pacific Maritime Security Strategy <a href="http://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/NDAA%20A-P_Maritime_SecuritY_Strategy-08142015-1300-FINALFORMAT.PDF">here.</a>

<strong>BJ Armstrong</strong>

The Asia-Pacific Maritime Security Strategy performs two valuable services. First it distinctly identifies what the Department feels are the most pressing challenges and openings. The clear identification of problems with the People’s Republic of China is matched by recognition of the opportunities for cooperation with partners like India and the ASEAN nations. Second, it pulls together the specific military initiatives being pursued in the region. While these have been available to interested parties, they have been discussed in disparate places and the document finally brings them together. In completing these tasks it keeps within the bounds of its charter and generally fulfils the NDAA’s requirements.

However, the bounds of its charter may be too narrow. At the turn of the 20th century the great American strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan recognized that the Asia-Pacific region was going to become more important to America’s interests and prosperity. He wrote that planning for that importance required a distinctly maritime strategy, but one that looked beyond just the military implications.

Today’s strategy recognizes that the rise of China creates “political, economic, and military” considerations, which fits neatly into Mahan’s thinking on national power and grand strategy. Yet the document makes no real effort to tie its military discussion to those other considerations or to a larger effort. The Departments of State, Commerce, and Homeland Security, and other national security agencies, will have critical roles in forwarding American goals in the Asia-Pacific. This requires more than just staff coordination. The DoD strategy is an important step forward and adds nicely to the Asia-Pacific discussion in the recently released Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower. There is, however, still more to be done, and a broader maritime strategy to be written, if the nation is going to use all elements of national maritime power in the region.

<strong>Scott Cheney-Peters </strong>

The Pentagon’s new Asia-Pacific Maritime Security Strategy is a welcome document, with credit due in part to the originating NDAA legislative language. Instead of asking for a maritime strategy with an objective focused on countering China as its starting point, Congress asked for a report that first “outlines the strategy of the Department of Defense with regard to maritime security” and second assesses how China’s actions and military capabilities are impacting that strategy – in ways both positive and negative. The documents succeeds in this and goes one further, making a case for the importance to the United States of maritime security in Asia and of three supporting national security objectives.

But the document does not focus solely on China’s actions. In a well-written and even-handed “Strategic Context” section, the strategy untangles the regional mess of claim disputes. By detailing the range of excessive claims with which the United States takes issue, such as Malaysian and Vietnamese attempts to restrict military activities within their EEZs, it serves as a good resource for countering charges the United States “takes sides” in disputes or singles out Chinese actions. In a contrast with the situation in the East and South China Seas, the Strategy also highlights the peaceful manner by which India’s maritime disputes have been resolved or lie dormant. The net effect is to show what it is about China’s actions that are particularly upsetting to the U.S. strategy, namely the speed and scale of unilateral changes to the status quo undertaken at the expense of efforts for peaceful resolution of the underlying disputes.

The second half of the strategy is similarly useful in providing a rundown of DOD programs and initiatives. But it will disappoint “ends-ways-means” strategy purists due to the at-times muddled relationship between the overarching goal: “to preserve security in this vital region,” the “three maritime objectives in the Asia-Pacific region,” and the four “Lines of Effort” (LOEs). This matters because when clouded, gaps can appear.

Much has been said of the ability of China to exploit coercive techniques short of war to advance its goals. Yet DOD’s objective of “deterring conflict or coercion” and several LOEs similarly conflate conflict and coercion, meaning the strategy ends up avoiding discussing whether coercion can really be deterred in the same way conflict can, and whether tailored measures are needed for the deterrence of coercion. This matters less if you believe the United States has been as successful at deterring coercion as it has been at deterring conflict, or if no further coercive acts are likely to be undertaken. But the document itself ably puts this to lie in the first section. So while the objective of deterrence is naturally conservative, the status quo has already been upset, and the Strategy neither makes clear which of the enumerated efforts are meant to halt the campaign of coercion underway nor how success in coercion deterrence would be measured.

This is not to say the LOEs will have no deterrent effect on coercion, but in treating coercion as indistinguishable from conflict, the strategy misses an opportunity to provide a stronger strategic underpinning for dealing with the range of challenges the U.S. faces in the Asia-Pacific.

<strong>James Holmes </strong>

<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Thayer_Mahan">Alfred Thayer Mahan</a> would applaud the purposes impelling the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/NDAA%20A-P_Maritime_SecuritY_Strategy-08142015-1300-FINALFORMAT.PDF">Pentagon’s new maritime security strategy</a>, while <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.C._Wylie">J. C. Wylie</a> might voice qualms about how Washington will deploy power at sea to fulfill those purposes. On balance there’s much to like here.

Now, Mahan <em>might</em> grouse about the document’s discarding his description of the seas as a “wide common.” That metaphor has been a <a href="http://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2009-07/contested-commons">staple</a> of U.S. strategic documents for years now. Yet he would instantly acknowledge and embrace its advocacy of keeping open <a href="http://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2009-12/mahans-lingering-ghost#footnotes">commercial, political, and military access</a> to this contested region, and of shaping a maritime consortium to defend that access while preserving <a href="http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/552">freedom of the sea</a>—the legal order that keeps the commons a commons.

The <a href="https://archive.org/details/problemasiaandi04mahagoog">problem of Asia</a> remains acute a century-plus after Mahan held forth on the topic, although the <a href="http://www.usni.org/store/books/chinese-navy/red-star-over-pacific">challenges</a> <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01495930590929663?journalCode=ucst20">now stem</a> from within the region rather than from seaborne Western conquerors. The Mahanian solution—open-ended cooperation among seagoing nations devoted to the rule of law—also remains much the same.

And American methods? Wylie makes “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=LpYWYCJge1kC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=wylie+strategy+system+measures&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KQ9a1CFPPN&amp;sig=Ha_VRIk77c9mpjF8lZHLgAW78zE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBmoVChMIzpa5g7-6xwIViXA-Ch2_NwG1#v=onepage&amp;q=wylie%20strategy%20system%20measures&amp;f=false">a system of measures</a>” for gauging progress a core, indispensable element of strategy. The maritime security strategy is vague on the numbers of ships, planes, and armaments the sea services will station in the Asia-Pacific, although far more specific than <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/07/the-elements-of-us-maritime-strategy/">previous strategies</a>. The standard figure—that <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/davidson/2014/11/17/admiral-greenert-speaks-what-should-the-u-s-navys-new-maritime-strategy-look-like/">60 percent of sea-service assets</a> will call this theater home by 2020—reappears. How X number of widgets or Y number of soldiers, sailors, or airmen will yield operational and strategic effects remains mostly unstated.

Wylie might note, however, that dispersed, “<a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/01/cumulative-warfare-war-by-statistics/">cumulative</a>” campaigns like policing the sea are vague and ethereal by their nature. One hopes Pentagon strategists are working behind the scenes to devise ways to <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/08/07/china_war_strategy_victory/">defeat</a>—not just manage—overt challenges to <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/chinas-selective-access-denial-strategy-9482">freedom of the sea</a>. The region’s future depends on it.

<strong>Peter Mattis </strong>

The new Department of Defense (DOD) <em>Asia-Pacific Maritime Security Strategy</em> outlines U.S. objectives and supporting activities in a clear document, expanding in detail on the themes in the White House’s National Security Strategy. The new strategy also offers a necessary explanation for the American public of how and why the United States is committed to Asia.

In contrast to the authorizing legislation, the Pentagon avoided making the strategy document China-centric, acknowledging that Beijing is not the only bad regional actor with excessive claims or threatening to interfere with free passage. China is just the biggest. Even <a href="http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2015-08/22/content_21669757.htm">the <em>China Daily</em> had to pivot away from the strategy</a> itself to imply Washington was stirring up trouble. On the negative side, however, the Pentagon failed to answer Congress’s question about the specific effects of the U.S. military’s engagement with their Chinese counterparts. DOD missed an opportunity to identify how the sometimes controversial U.S.-China military-to-military relationship benefits this strategy and broader U.S. approach to China apart from more dialogue channels — <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-06/20/c_134343347.htm">now more than 90, according to Xinhua</a>.

The structured ends, ways, and means approach suggests a focused, well-coordinated U.S. government effort to engage Asian states on maritime security issues. This may be true for the Defense Department; however, the rest of the government is less coherent. FON may be a matter of principle for DOD, but the White House’s willingness to reduce or halt FON exercises to signal Beijing undermines the principled U.S. approach the strategy explains. Moreover, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anti-Access-Warfare-Countering-A2-Strategies/dp/1612511864">breaking anti-access/area-denial systems historically requires a diplomatic effort</a> beyond strengthening the military edge, as promised in the Third Offset.

U.S. policy is evolving by degree—increased engagement, military presence, capacity building, etc.—but Asia’s maritime environment seems less stable. One wonders, then, if this strategy works. Good strategy requires the ability to assess its effectiveness and revise as necessary.

<strong>Bryan McGrath</strong>

The Department of Defense effectively and methodically answered the tasking required of it in the 2015 NDAA. The Asia-Pacific Maritime Security Strategy lays out in a straightforward and informative manner what the issues are, what the United States’ equities are, and to the extent that an unclassified document can, specifies a generalized approach to reconciling the two.  It is concise, well-written, pleasing to the eye, and possessed of sound strategic logic.

My reservations stem not from the logic of the strategy so much as they do from the pace and content of the implementation thereof.  To this point, I turn to General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson (CSA) as my default “navalist” of note to further evaluate the document, a sign both of my pitiful background in classical naval theory and my deep interest in the Civil War.  Jackson once said, “To move swiftly, strike vigorously, and secure all the fruits of victory, is the secret of successful war”, and while what is underway in the Indo-Pacific is not war, it is clearly competition, Great Power, as well as regional.

One side—the Chinese—is moving at a pace that is relatively quicker than the other, broadly represented by the United States.  And while precipitous moves by either side would be unwise, the pace of implementation of the United States’ desire to strengthen its military capacity in the region is lagging.  Most of the initiatives cited in the document have been underway for years and largely represent the redistribution of a shrinking force.  New thinking should be applied with alacrity, such as a program to build a large number of missile patrol boats for U.S. Navy and partner operation in co-located or even hybrid squadrons in the region, a force that could counter the maritime “mass” China uses to intimidate and coerce.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On August 20, The Department of Defense released <a href="http://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/NDAA%20A-P_Maritime_SecuritY_Strategy-08142015-1300-FINALFORMAT.PDF">its Asia-Pacific Maritime Security Strategy</a>.  Mandated by Section 1259 of the FY 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, the report outlines DOD’s strategy for maritime security in the region. On August 21, Assistant Secretary of Defense David Shear <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?327750-1/defense-department-briefing-maritime-security-strategy">briefed the press</a> on the new document. Team AMTI commends its readers to the full report, but has also compiled a maritime strategy cheat sheet. Read on below for the substantive and visual highlights.

The new strategy begins by identifying <strong>U.S. maritime objectives</strong> in the Asia-Pacific region. These include:

<ul>
	<li><strong>Freedom of the Seas</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Deterrence of Coercion and Conflict</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Promotion of Adherence to International Law and Standards</strong></li>
</ul>
U.S. objectives are explained and justified in terms of U.S. national interest. The geographic scope of these objectives stretches from the Indian Ocean, to the South and East China Seas, and into the Pacific for the purposes of the document.

The report identifies the fact that the security environment is rapidly changing, and doing so in ways that could challenge the stability of the region. These include:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Competing territorial and maritime claims</strong>. The report gives an overview of competing claims in the East China Sea, South China Sea, and Indian Ocean. It disaggregates competing claims into three groups:
<ul>
	<li>Competing territorial claims;</li>
	<li>Competing maritime claims;</li>
	<li>Excessive maritime claims.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Military and maritime law enforcement modernization</strong>. The report gives an overview of maritime capabilities modernization in the region and compares the navies and coast guards of several regional states.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Maritime challenges</strong>. These include the expanded use of non-military assets to coerce other states, and the resort to unsafe air and maritime maneuvers. They also include the use of land reclamation on disputed features.</li>
</ul>
This security challenges section is noteworthy for its even-handedness. China is by no means the only claimant under discussion. The excessive maritime claims and military modernization efforts of other countries are scrutinized. This section also notes some positive developments toward regional dispute resolution, including the Philippines’ decision to seek arbitration under UNCLOS.

The report illustrates these security challenges with several useful graphics. These include a detailed map of all outposts in the Spratly Islands (note that this is counting the number of <em>outposts</em> and not the number of occupied features); charts that compare regional navies and coast guards; and a detailed timeline of construction and installation efforts by all claimants in the Spratly Islands.

<a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/maritimelaw_comparison.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3844" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/maritimelaw_comparison.jpg" alt="maritimelaw_comparison" width="100%" /></a>

Finally, the report identifies four different <strong>lines of effort</strong> that comprise the Department of Defense’s <strong>maritime strategy</strong> for the region. These include:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Strengthening U.S. military capabilities in the maritime domain. </strong>The United States is investing in new surface combatants (<em>USS Ronald Reagan</em>, <em>USS America</em>, DDG-1000 stealth destroyers) and complimenting these with the deployment of F-22, B-2, and B-52 aircraft. Many of the Department’s F-35s are also intended for Asia. DOD is basing an additional attack submarine in Guam, and investing in missile capabilities relevant to the maritime domain to allow for greater stand-off distances. Over the longer term, DOD intends to counteract A2/AD advances in the region through the Third Offset. The Pentagon is also enhancing force posture and presence in the region. Access agreements with Australia and the Philippines and a modernized presence in Guam are central to these efforts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Building the maritime capacity of allies and partners. </strong>The Pentagon is improving interoperability, updating combined exercises, and helping partners to develop their own maritime domain awareness and security capabilities. These efforts include Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia, and India is identified as a partner in regional capacity building.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Using military diplomacy to reduce risk and increase transparency. </strong>The Pentagon pursues a military-to-military relationship with China based on three pillars: substantive dialogue through senior leader engagement; practical cooperation in areas of shared interest; risk reduction measures. These efforts have experienced positive momentum since 2012. Region-wide transparency efforts include the adoption of the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES) and Pentagon support for risk reduction in the East China Sea.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Strengthening the regional architecture. </strong>The Pentagon is buttressing its engagement with regional institutions, including ADMM-Plus, ARF, and the Expanded ASEAN Maritime Forum. It is also deepening involvement with the Western Pacific Naval Symposium (WPNS) and the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS).</li>

		<title>The Enabling Role of UNCLOS III in PRC Maritime Policy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[To what extent does the law of the sea influence PRC decisions about maritime policy? If there is any influence, does it on balance play a <em>constraining </em>or <em>enabling</em> role in Beijing’s decisionmaking in this domain? This brief, mostly conceptual article argues that the enabling effects are more significant. For Beijing, UNCLOS III functions to <em>create</em> options for policymakers who view it as an instrument (mostly rhetorical) to protect Chinese maritime security and economic interests (mostly static). Although the black letters of UNCLOS III grant coastal states only modest legal authority beyond their 12 nautical mile territorial sea, Beijing’s legal advisers read the treaty opportunistically and inconsistently. Their input into the policy process tends to encourage and legitimize expanding PRC control over maritime space beyond the normal, narrow limits of coastal state jurisdiction – often at the expense of other legitimate users.

In formulating and implementing maritime policy, China’s maritime policymakers construe the PRC’s claimed maritime <em>rights </em>as broadly (and vaguely) as possible while downplaying or ignoring the unwelcome legal <em>obligations </em>paired with those rights. Beijing’s purposeful interpretation of the treaty’s rules and norms enables it to assert nominally <em>legal</em> authorities to (i) expand and regulate Chinese actors’ and firms’ exploitation of marine resources, (ii) prescribe and enforce PRC jurisdiction through legislation, regulation, and practical maritime law enforcement (MLE), and (iii) formally deny (or at least complicate) access and use of waters under China’s claimed jurisdiction by other states’ militaries (especially the U.S. Navy).

Pursuing those more or less fixed ends, Chinese central leadership solicits legal advice on the law of the sea from specialized academic institutions and think-tanks.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> These maritime law and policy experts (as well as the many non-experts crowding into what is now an attractive and lucrative policy arena) help Beijing maintain the diplomatic premise that China is acting within constraints described by international law, even as it pursues high-priority economic and security interests that are frequently in tension with international rules and norms. More positively, these analysts are helping Beijing craft maritime policy that leverages China’s size and growing capacity to exploit the evolving law of the sea regime by way of “creeping jurisdiction.” That is, China draws on questionable “expert” readings of the treaty to claim steadily broader and deeper legal rights, backed up by legally significant practical assertions of those rights.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>

This specialized community rarely, if ever, provides analysis or advice that acknowledges – much less prescribes – legal constraints on China’s pursuit of broader rights to control and regulate claimed maritime space. Their contributions resemble those of a lawyer whose difficult client has already decided upon a risky course of action. Believing that neither litigation nor legal punishment poses a realistic threat, the client is not moved by lawyerly concerns about legal defects in the plan. The lawyer’s job is therefore to reverse-engineer a legal basis for the desired actions. Indeed, China’s law of the sea and international law specialists thus tend to <em>work</em> <em>backwards</em> from existing or planned maritime policy decisions. They cherry-pick rules and principles from international law, loosely appeal to “history” as a trump, and develop arguments couched in the language of maritime law to promote those policies. Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokespeople then draw on these legal justifications (some of them directly produced or commissioned by the State Council bureaucracy and its growing number of maritime “research” organs)<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> to market PRC maritime policies to the international community as lawful practices. Sometimes the parameters of UNCLOS III serve to fine-tune elements of policy implementation;<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> in other cases, a political demand to satisfy legal tests for effective control appears to drive the time and place of a variety of “assertive” behaviors by MLE and naval forces.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>

So what? Observers of the China’s generally hostile attitude toward international law will recognize that its participation in international treaty regimes like UNCLOS III is a fairly new and uncertain enterprise. Beyond its extensive use of WTO arbitration procedures and acceptance of some adverse awards, there is little evidence that China respects or accepts the legitimacy of rules that are not to its direct advantage. Observers of international law generally will also note that states, especially great powers like China, can “auto-interpret” treaty obligations that require domestic implementation, meaning that they are unlikely to internalize costly rules or norms without enforcement. National courts may be sufficient to give treaties some “bite” in rule of law systems, but no such constraint exists in contemporary China.

If China’s political leaders want the Spratly Islands (and any artificial islands created in their vicinity) to generate an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in which the PRC enjoys special “security” jurisdiction not prescribed in the treaty, or to reject the legitimacy of a compulsory arbitral award, or to deny the existence of international disputes over seabed resources and fisheries, its legal system is simply not empowered to check that practice. Individuals specialized in law of the sea and maritime policy issues, who in other circumstances might counsel restraint, not only lack incentives to do so – they are mandated to produce legal justifications for maritime policy decisions undertaken by political elites. China is by no means alone among parties to UNCLOS III in turning practices that are plainly non-compliant into state policy,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> but it is nearly unique in its capacity to mobilize personnel and resources at scale to steadily push the international community toward accepting those practices. The upshot is that the South and East China seas are beginning to look like a <em>sui generis </em>maritime zone uncontemplated in UNCLOS III, and unaccountable to the legal and prudential constraints that maritime policy decisionmakers in other states observe. The various obligatory constraints on rights and practices mandated in the treaty do not surface in China’s policy consultation process, and cannot be expected to moderate Beijing’s continuing efforts to consolidate effective control in its “near seas.”

<a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> e.g., The PRC National Institute for South China Sea Studies in Haikou, the South China Sea Center at Xiamen University Law School, the Collaborative Innovation Center for South China Sea Studies at Nanjing University, the international law faculty at Tsinghua and Wuhan Universities, Oceans Universities in both Dalian and Qingdao, a specialized department on Shipping and Maritime Law at the East China University of Politics and Law, and many others enjoy substantial financial and political support from the central government (the Ministries of Education and Foreign Affairs prominent among them). They also train an increasing number of Chinese law undergraduates and law masters students who are oversubscribe to classes on the application of the law of the sea to contemporary policy issues.
<a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> This is not a phenomenon limited to the core issues of sovereignty. Nearly every aspect of China’s policies concerning the law of the sea – its default to straight baselines, drawing of archipelagic baselines around island groups, legislation pronouncing “security” rights in contiguous and exclusive economic zones, and so on – attempts to seize broader and deeper rights than the Convention permits. These non-compliant claims do not become more lawful by repeated practice, but they do become more “normal” and difficult to oppose politically and operationally.
<a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> For example, the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs was created in 2009 and staffed with law of the sea experts, some on loan from universities, some merely hired as expert consultants; the State Oceanic Administration’s in-house think-tank, China Institute for Marine Affairs (CIMA), is staffed by experienced law of the sea analysts and directed by a sitting judge on the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.
<a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> The “981” controversy from summer 2014 is an interesting illustration of how the various parameters of UNCLOS zones define the specifics of a policy: China chose to deploy the rig more than 12nm from any feature, and kept it on the Chinese side of a notional median line with Vietnam. This placement indicated not simply that China maintained a sovereignty claim to the Paracel Islands, but that China asserted an EEZ from the Paracels that should have at least partial effects, therefore diminishing the scope of Vietnam’s EEZ.
<a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> For example, the PRC’s decision to deploy MLE vessels to the territorial seas around the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands in 2012 was expressly designed to undermine Japan’s effective control and administration of a specific jurisdictional zone described in UNCLOS. Had China’s intent been simply to show it could send government or military vessels to Japanese-claimed waters, or that it rejected Japan’s claim to sovereignty over the islands themselves, there would have been no cause to adopt a policy that hinged specifically on operating within 12nm and conducting law enforcement missions.
<a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6">[6]</a> Peru’s 200nm territorial sea claim is a vivid example.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>China’s Maritime Rights Protection Leading Small Group—Shrouded in Secrecy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

Foreign policy decisionmaking in China has always been opaque, but under Chinese Communist Party General Secretary and President Xi Jinping, it has become even more cryptic. The strongest leader to come to power in more than two decades, Xi has concentrated power in his own hands and rarely vets foreign policy initiatives with the bureaucracy. In the past several years, decisionmaking has been at times rash and impulsive. This is evident especially in maritime affairs, including the announcement of an East China Sea air defense identification zone (ADIZ) in November 2013, the deployment of a deep water oil drilling rig in disputed waters near the coast of Vietnam in May 2014, and the frenetic-paced dredging in the South China Sea since early 2014.

Deliberations on maritime matters, when they occur, apparently take place in the Central Maritime Rights Protection Leading Small Group (中央海洋权益工作领导小组), which Xi Jinping heads. The group was established in mid-2012 with a mandate to do <a href="http://ocean.china.com.cn/2013-03/02/content_28105606.htm">three things</a>: 1) to formulate strategies to advance China’s maritime rights and interests; 2) to coordinate policy among numerous state entities in charge of maritime affairs; and 3) to manage growing conflict with other countries over disputed maritime territories. Members include high-level representatives from 17 government branches, <a href="http://www.lowyinstitute.org/files/chinas-unpredictable-maritime-security-actors_3.pdf">including</a> the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), the State Oceanic Administration (SOA), the Ministry of Public Security (MPS), the Ministry of State Security (MSS), the Ministry of Agriculture, and the PLA Navy (PLAN).

<a href="http://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/CLM26AM.pdf">Leading Small Groups</a> (LSGs) are informal advisory mechanisms that are regularly used in China to manage specific policy areas, deliberate important or urgent issues, and provide policy recommendations to the Politburo Standing Committee. There are currently 18 central LSGs, <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2015-07-24/chinas-un-separation-powers">seven</a> of which are headed by Xi Jinping himself. LSGs convene on an as-needed basis. While meetings of LSGs that handle economic policy are now regularly reported by the Chinese media, including summaries of discussions and decisions, details about LSGs that are in charge of foreign policy issues are rarely disclosed.

The CCP’s Foreign Affairs Office (FAO) performs administrative functions for the Maritime Rights Protection LSG as well as for the Foreign Affairs LSG and the National Security LSG, both of which Xi Jinping also heads. The FAO is headed by Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi. Housed within the FAO is the Central Maritime Affairs Leading Small Group Office. Its vice chairman, under Yang, is <a href="http://www.chinavitae.com/biography/Kong_Quan">Kong Quan</a>, a diplomat who was formerly ambassador to France. Sources say that Xi frequently tasks the FAO to provide research and convene meetings. Research institutes that provide analysis and recommendations on maritime issues include the National Institute for South China Sea Studies located in Hainan province, the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations under the MSS, the PLA’s Naval Research Institute, and the China Institute for Marine Affairs, affiliated with the SOA.

Little is known about the work of the Maritime Rights Protection LSG. According to a few media reports, the LSG has been known to <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/all-the-toys-but-can-china-fight-20130426-2ikmm.html">direct the tactical movements</a> of Chinese surveillance vessels and navy ships <a href="http://www.asahi.com/articles/DA3S11530796.html">“over radio or television phone.”</a> Since the creation of the Maritime Rights Protection LSG, coordination has been notably enhanced among the navy, coast guard, SOA, and maritime militia. Beginning in November 2014, the entry of Chinese law-enforcement ships into the 12nm territorial sea around the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea that are administered by Japan but claimed by China (as well as by Taiwan), which takes place three times per month, is choreographed with PLAN ships that simultaneously sail closer to the edge of the 24nm contiguous zone. It is possible that the LSG is providing guidance for such maneuvers.

Whether and when to establish an ADIZ in the South China Sea could be deliberated in the Maritime Rights Protection LSG. The decision to create the East China Sea ADIZ was likely not discussed in any LSG. Instead, it was probably raised in a Central Military Commission meeting, where Xi Jinping is chairman, and then approved by the Politburo Standing Committee (PBSC). Based on private discussions I have had with Chinese officials, the MFA was not consulted before the establishment of the East China Sea ADIZ. If the ministry had been in the loop, it probably would have weighed in against including an overlap with South Korea’s ADIZ, given the priority that was being accorded to improving Beijing’s relations with Seoul. Chinese scholars privately say Xi Jinping has learned lessons from that and other incidents in which hasty decisions had negative repercussions for Chinese interests, although there is little, if any, evidence to support this.

What little is known about the Maritime Rights Protection LSG and Chinese decisionmaking is based on interviews and a few investigative media reports. There is much more that is not known. For example, who determines when to convene the LSG? On issues that are deliberated within the LSG, if consensus is not reached, does Xi Jinping make the final decision himself or is the matter hashed out among PBSC members? Is the LSG involved in decisionmaking regarding land reclamation, construction, and militarization in the South China Sea? As long as foreign policy decisionmaking in China remains shrouded in secrecy, the answers to these questions will be difficult to uncover.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Xi in Command: Downsizing and Reorganizing the People’s Liberation Army (PLA)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While many eyes were focused on China’s massive military parade in Beijing last week, which displayed a number of types of advanced military hardware, such as missiles, tanks, and fighter jets, another potentially much more important story about the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) appeared to be unfolding, albeit largely behind the scenes.

According to recent media reports, Xi Jinping is about to accomplish a major reorganization of the PLA designed to give it a more modern, streamlined and joint command structure at the national and regional levels. In a speech at the commemoration on September 3, Xi announced that China would <a href="http://eng.mod.gov.cn/DefenseNews/2015-09/03/content_4617101.htm">reduce the number of troops in the PLA by 300,000</a>,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> but that is only a first step in a more ambitious reform and reorganization plan. Xi’s intent to reform the PLA was made clear in a document the Chinese Communist Party released following the November 2013 Third Plenum of the 18<sup>th</sup> Central Committee.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> The goal is a command structure that is better aligned with the PLA’s missions and would improve its ability to successfully execute joint military operations (those involving two or more of the PLA’s services). In short, the changes would be aimed at improving the PLA’s ability to deter or coerce potential adversaries, and if necessary to fight and prevail in future wars. For many years, PLA strategists have seen a mismatch between the PLA’s traditional organizational structure and the requirements of commanding such operations in a fast-paced, information-intensive military campaign against a capable adversary. There have been rumors about sweeping changes on a number of occasions, such as in January 2014 when Japanese media reported that the PLA was on the verge of restructuring its military region (MR) organizational system to reduce the number of MRs and make them more joint,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> but major organizational changes of the type reportedly about to be announced have been deferred, at least until now.  This is presumably due in part to the complexity of the project, but perhaps even more so to opposition from parts of the military that stand to lose influence or otherwise see their power and resources diminished as a result of the reorganization.

If Xi succeeds where previous Chinese leaders have failed to achieve the desired results, one important reason could be the way his vigorous and unprecedented anti-corruption campaign has unfolded in the PLA in recent years, which has included many high-ranking targets, most notably former Central Military Commission (CMC) vice chairmen Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong. Indeed, while there are a number of other reasons to move aggressively against rampant corruption, which has involved serious problems such as the buying and selling of promotions within the military, sidelining potential opposition to organizational change could turn out to be one of the most important. According to one retired PLA officer quoted in a Western media report, Xi Jinping “mainly employed the anti-corruption campaign in the military to form his absolute command over the army, so that his military restructuring plan can press ahead after being initially stalled.” As a result, according to the same officer, “Now, his authority in the army is solid enough for him to flesh out his vision to transform the military and set it on a path to emulate the U.S.”<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>

Whatever the role of the anti-corruption campaign in facilitating these organizational reforms, if successfully implemented, they could have enormous implications for the PLA in numerous areas, including its strategy, operations, and the relationships between the traditionally dominant ground force, and the air, naval, and missile forces. Indeed, the growing importance of the air, naval, and missile forces is highlighted in China’s 2015 white paper on military strategy, which reflects a stronger emphasis on maritime missions, in which the PLA Air Force (PLAAF), PLA Navy (PLAN), and PLA Second Artillery Force (PLASAF, China’s strategic missile force) would play increasingly important roles as their capabilities continue to improve.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Chinese military media reports suggest very strongly that major reforms are coming soon. Perhaps most notably, <em>PLA Daily</em> recently stated that such reforms “will soon unfold” and demanded that military officers earnestly study Xi Jinping’s “important expositions of deepening defense and military reform.”<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> As Andrew Erickson of the U.S. Naval War College has observed, such reports bear close watching, because in the PRC, “this is how you grab Chinese officials’ attention.”<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>

Although the exact shape of the reforms has yet to be announced, they reportedly will involve steps such as reducing the number of MRs and restructuring them to make them more suited to modern joint warfighting. Another aspect of the reforms aimed at making the PLA more joint could involve putting the ground force on a more equal footing with the air, naval, and missile forces through the establishment of a ground force headquarters with a status equal to that of the headquarters of the PLAAF, PLAN, and PLASAF.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> Creating a separate PLA Army (PLAA) headquarters would be a departure from a longstanding system in which the PLAAF, PLAN, and PLASAF each has its own headquarters, but the PLA’s powerful four General Departments—the General Staff, General Political, General Logistics, and General Armament Departments –effectively serve as the army’s headquarters and are heavily dominated by ground force officers, thus allowing the army to maintain greater influence than the PLA’s other components. Whatever the exact details of the reforms, it seems almost certain they will take a long time to fully implement.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> Nonetheless, even announcing the reforms and beginning to put them into place would represent a major accomplishment for Xi Jinping, and an important step forward in China’s quest to realize its longstanding goal of building a stronger and more modern military.

We will improve the joint combat command organizations of the CMC and the joint combat command mechanism of theaters, and push forward the reform of the system of training and logistics for joint combat operations…We will optimize the size and composition of the armed forces, adjust and improve the ratios between the services and arms, between officers and soldiers, and between troops and military offices, and reduce the number of non-combat departments and staff.” For the full text, see “Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Some Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening the Reform,” January 16, 2014,  <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/china/third_plenary_session/2014-01/16/content_31212602.htm">http://www.china.org.cn/china/third_plenary_session/2014-01/16/content_31212602.htm</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While Russia has employed “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_green_men_(2014_Crimean_crisis)">Little Green Men</a>” surreptitiously in Crimea, China uses its own “<a href="http://www.andrewerickson.com/2015/08/tracking-chinas-little-blue-men-a-comprehensive-maritime-militia-compendium/">Little Blue Men</a>” to support Near Seas claims. As the U.S. military operates near Beijing’s artificially-built <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/east-asia/2015-04-09/china-s-island-builders">South China Sea</a> (SCS) features and seeks to prevent Beijing from ejecting foreign claimants from places like <a href="http://www.jamestown.org/programs/chinabrief/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=41054&amp;cHash=a7d10c92688430f1274bb09b95b18bcf#.VdoFHtNViko">Second Thomas Shoal</a>, it may well face surveillance and harassment from China’s <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2015/03/31/meet-the-chinese-maritime-militia-waging-a-peoples-war-at-sea/">maritime militia</a>. Washington and its allies and partners must therefore understand how these irregular forces are commanded and controlled, before they are surprised and <a href="http://stockton.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1406&amp;context=ils">stymied by them</a>.

China has long organized its civilian mariners into maritime militia, largely out of necessity. Recent years have seen a surge of emphasis on maritime militia building and increasing this unique force’s capabilities; however it is difficult to ascertain who or what entity within China’s government has ordered such emphasis. One can point to Xi Jinping’s visit to the <a href="http://www.nationalinterest.org/feature/tanmen-militia-china%E2%80%99s-maritime-rights-protection-vanguard-12816">Tanmen Maritime Militia</a> in 2013, after which maritime militia building oriented toward the SCS has seen growth in places like Hainan, Guangdong, and Guangxi. Yet local militia training and organization plans prior to this date had already emphasized the training of maritime militia units.

<strong>Unit Composition and Organization </strong>

China’s militia has two major subcomponents: an “ordinary” reserve of registered male citizens akin to the U.S. Selective Service pool, and a “primary” force more readily mobilized to respond to various contingencies. The primary force receives dedicated resources, troops demobilized from active duty, and training. Within the primary force, maritime militia units—formed solely at the tactical level of organization—are smaller and more specialized on average than their land-based counterparts. Within the maritime militia, a small but growing elite set of units are the ones most likely to be deployed on more sophisticated operations that involve monitoring, displaying presence in front of, or opposing foreign actors. They do so in part by supporting China’s navy and coast guard in such efforts. Some cities with large mobilization potential—i.e., a large maritime industry or fishing community—will form battalion-sized units. Most localities create company-sized units, however. These companies are divided into platoons and squads, with the smallest grouping based on each individual vessel.

<strong>Chain of Command</strong>

Militia management begins broadly at the General Staff Department’s Mobilization Department, which oversees and formulates regulations for nationwide militia work. Uniquely a local military force, the maritime militia falls within the hierarchical People’s Liberation Army (PLA) army local force command structure that runs through all levels of local military organs. As stipulated in China’s “<a href="http://www.gov.cn/banshi/gm/content_63632.htm">Militia Work Regulations</a>,” real command of the militia begins at the Provincial Military District (MD) level and below. The thousands of county- and grassroots-level People’s Armed Forces Departments (PAFD) established in county-level cities, townships, villages, and maritime enterprises (fishing companies, shipyards, etc.) directly execute the organizing and training of maritime militia. Grassroots-level PAFDs report to county-level PAFDs, which report to Military Sub-district (MSD) Headquarters, themselves reporting to MD Headquarters. Maritime militia building also receives attention by Military Region-level Command, albeit in a supervisory fashion. Higher levels of military commands likely view the maritime militia as a subset of military organization within the broader ecosystem of local militia, with particular focus on broader mobilization efforts. Additionally, militia battalions and companies form party branches to ensure Party control at the grassroots levels.

It must be emphasized that maritime militia command authority resides within multiple entities, including both the local military organs (MD, MSD, PAFD) and their government/party counterparts. This is referred to as “双重领导” in Chinese, connoting the “dual-leadership” system by the local military and government’s principal leaders. It is thus common to see a city party secretary acting in his role as first-party secretary of the local military party committee overseeing the PAFD’s efforts at managing the maritime militia. An easily visible example: Sansha City’s mayor/party secretary Xiao Jie and his military counterpart Commander Cai Xihong both attended the founding ceremony of Sansha City’s Maritime Militia Company. “Dual-leadership” is further reinforced by the fact that local governments fund militia construction.

Since both military and government leaders are involved in local armed forces building, the National Defense Mobilization Committee System (<a href="http://www.gov.cn/xxgk/pub/govpublic/mrlm/201108/t20110812_63985.html">NDMC</a>) established at each corresponding level plays the critical role in binding them into one decision-making body. The NDMC brings together these leaders to organize, direct, and coordinate nationwide national defense mobilization, ensuring that national resources can be rapidly mobilized for defense or emergency needs. Local NDMCs can also establish civilian-military <a href="http://kns55.en.eastview.com/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?recid=&amp;FileName=GUOF201412048&amp;DbName=CJFD2014&amp;DbCode=CJFD">joint command structures</a> facilitated by national defense mobilization communications networks. As a militia force, the maritime militia would need a specified duration to mobilize and gather in the area designated by their superiors. Localized mobilization orders transmitted to the maritime militia could originate from a variety of sources. Regardless, they would be sent down the chain and delivered to the maritime militia via the PAFDs managing them.

While county-level PAFDs are manned by active duty PLA officers, grassroots-level PAFDs are manned by civilian government cadres. <a href="http://kns55.en.eastview.com/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?recid=&amp;FileName=GUOF201402048&amp;DbName=CJFD2014&amp;DbCode=CJFD">Training and education</a> efforts target a “select group of militia cadres” (专职人民武装干部), units’ leaders (company, platoon, and squad) and “information personnel” (信息员). This group of personnel forms the backbone of the maritime militia and helps implement party control, command and control, and maintain unit cohesiveness. Essential to successful command and control of the maritime militia are the “boat captains”—often termed “船老大”—and the information personnel, which provide dedicated personnel for onboard leadership, identification, and communications. This is further facilitated by increasing incorporation of satellite communications technologies into the fishing fleet and thereby into the maritime militia.

<strong>Mission-based Command Authority</strong>

Although maritime militia are built out of the regular command structure of coastal military organs, they also serve naval and maritime law enforcement forces (MLE). The command relationships for the maritime militia may vary with the mission they are employed in. <a href="http://kns55.en.eastview.com/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?recid=&amp;FileName=GUOF201402048&amp;DbName=CJFD2014&amp;DbCode=CJFD">For example,</a> maritime militia reconnaissance detachments report their findings directly to MD Headquarters, while another detachment summoned to assist with maritime law enforcement would be commanded by the Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) “in cooperation with their MD.” Similarly, support detachments serving roles for China’s navy would be under the command of the PLA Navy in cooperation with the detachment’s MD. It is clear that the maritime militia are controlled by their land-based local military organs, an arrangement flexible enough to serve a variety of supporting roles for the Chinese Navy and MLE forces. Many Chinese sources use a phrase that succinctly states such arrangements: “the military organ expresses its requirements, the NDMC coordinates, and the government implements” (<a href="http://kns55.en.eastview.com/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?recid=&amp;FileName=GUOF201408060&amp;DbName=CJFD2014&amp;DbCode=CJFD">军事机关提需求、国动委搞协调、政府抓落实</a>), referring to the cooperation that occurs between civilian and military leaders in building the maritime militia.

<strong>More than One Way to Tie the Knot</strong>

Organization and command of maritime militia likely varies by locality. This stems largely from a given locality’s maritime industry and its influence on militia composition, requiring local leaders to plan maritime militia missions from what is available. Making command and decision making arrangements based on local conditions is critical to the proper functioning of such a force. Many ad hoc leading small groups are formed to handle a certain issue area, or provide temporary guidance for certain missions. The multiple organizations supporting maritime militia building (e.g., the CCG, Fisheries Bureau, and Maritime Safety Administration) are likely to enter these command structures in some fashion.

The <a href="http://www.andrewerickson.com/2015/09/china-military-parade-3-september-2015-your-complete-hardware-and-logistics-guide-updated-version/">300,000-troop reduction</a> that Xi announced at Beijing’s <a href="http://www.andrewerickson.com/2015/09/showtime-china-reveals-two-carrier-killer-missiles/">3 September military parade</a> will likely send additional personnel to the maritime militia, and could even further shape their command and control. Specifically, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2015/09/02/sweeping-change-in-chinas-military-xis-pla-restructuring/">efforts to streamline</a> the current long reporting chain through land-based forces might ensue. All the more reason that it’s vitally urgent to understand how China’s “<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2015/08/24/new-asia-pacific-maritime-security-strategy-necessary-but-insufficient/?mod=WSJBlog">Little Blue Men</a>” get their sailing orders, and what those orders might be.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>China’s Navy Lobby and its Impact on PRC Maritime Sovereignty Policies</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction</strong>

This paper assesses the influence of the PLA Navy (PLAN) and its affiliated individuals and organizations (referred to as the “PLAN Lobby” or “Navy Lobby”) on specific policies related to China’s “maritime sovereignty”.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>  A lobby is a group of individuals who use direct or indirect means to collectively or individually advocate policy positions to decisionmakers.  The PLAN Lobby advocates for larger naval budgets and seeks policies that emphasize the national importance of Chinese maritime interests and naval capabilities, and offers recommendations based on professional expertise on maritime and naval matters.

China’s “maritime sovereignty” policies involve protection of Chinese maritime territorial claims, and the assertion of Chinese maritime territorial rights.  This paper uses three case studies to assess the Navy Lobby’s influences:  the 1988 decision to use force against Vietnam over the Spratly Islands; the decision to acquire an aircraft carrier; and the 2013 decision on centralizing the management of China’s “maritime sovereignty enforcement capabilities.”  In each case, the analysis determined what the Navy Lobby wanted; how it sought to achieve its goals; and the outcome.

<strong>The 1988 Spratly Island Case</strong>

In 1988 Liu Huaqing, former PLAN Commander and then the Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, said that Premier Zhao Ziyang asked his opinion on the Spratly Islands.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>  Liu told Zhao that Vietnamese encroachment on Chinese sovereignty was a major problem and that China would have to respond militarily.  He noted some of the likely operational difficulties, and the potential material solutions.  Zhao took note of Liu’s assessment and in the end authorized the use of force.

Ultimately, the PLAN wanted high-level decisionmakers to take Vietnam’s actions seriously; to give the Navy the resources to address the threat; to authorize study of the tactics and operations for the mission; to give the PLAN a major role in planning and execution; and then to authorize execution of the operation.  The PLAN Lobby efforts involved building a consensus among the various military players and then presenting its views to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership as a unified position.  The Lobby appears to not have presented any alternatives and to have gone directly to the use of force, the difficulties that the operation would face, and what was needed to undertake the mission. The Navy essentially got everything it asked for.

<strong>The Aircraft Carrier Decision</strong>

A second vignette involves Chinese policy debates in the 1990s about whether to procure an aircraft carrier.  Admiral Liu’s biography makes clear what the PLAN Lobby wanted:  an aircraft carrier to support missions in Taiwan and the South China Sea, military diplomacy, and superpower deterrence. The Navy Lobby convened several meetings of the PLA to study the problem, gathering the leadership of the Commission for Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense (COSTIND), the General Staff Department’s Armament Department, and the leadership of the General Logistics Department.  After preliminary research on future PLAN mission requirements, the Lobby advanced these arguments at Naval Technology and Requirements work conferences, at working conferences of the PLA General Departments, and then presumably through the Central Military Commission.

Ultimately, Jiang Zemin and the CCP central leadership rejected the request.  At the time Jiang was advocating the “peaceful rise” concept to allay the fears of China’s growing power.  Additionally at this time, China’s overseas energy and trade dependence was not pronounced and so there was no pressing need for a power projection capability.  When China’s economic interests abroad expanded, the PLAN later sought “friendly guidance” from the Central Leadership on how to get what it wanted.  Hu Jintao’s “New Historic Missions” issued in 2004 subsequently provided a rationale for Navy “far seas” operations and for a carrier.  The PLAN eventually secured approval by reshaping the CCP leadership’s perception of the international security environment and of the importance of Chinese maritime interests.

<strong>The PLAN Influence Over “Maritime Sovereignty Enforcement” Policies</strong>

The third vignette involves a series of “maritime sovereignty enforcement” policies which the Navy advocated in the 1990s but really became significant in the early part of the 2000s.  At this time the PLAN lobby focused its attention on effective responses to maritime sovereignty encroachment by China’s rivals.  A united response was hard to achieve because of the many agencies involved.  Prior to 2013 the following six agencies were involved in the mission:  the China Maritime Border Police, China Maritime Surveillance, the Maritime Safety Administration, the General Administration of Customs, the Fisheries Law Enforcement Command, and the PLAN.  Starting in 2010 the PLAN Lobby began calling for a more centralized approach.  Rear Admiral Yin Zhuo pointed out that this many actors in the maritime sovereignty field means that: “[e]verybody builds his own boat, everybody sets up his own port station, everybody has his own radar for detection, and everybody has his own intelligence sources.  This not only causes building of redundant construction and waste of resources, it also leads to an inability to share information and makes cooperation difficult.”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>  To help address this inefficiency and shortcoming in operational effectiveness he called for the establishment of a supra-ministerial Leading Group to set policy and coordinate maritime sovereignty issues across both civilian and military agencies. The Navy Lobby also called for the centralization of the management of maritime enforcement activities under the control of the Navy.  Not surprisingly civilian maritime law enforcement agencies disagreed and called for civilian centralization—modeled after the U.S. Coast Guard.

The Navy Lobby did not get its wish.  Instead the State Council announced in 2013 that it would centralize enforcement activities under the State Oceanic Administration (SOA).  The restructuring plan also involved the creation of a commission—the State Oceanic Commission—to provide high-level policy guidance for the SOA.   The creation of a State Oceanic Commission to coordinate China’s civilian maritime law enforcement efforts is a far cry from the supra-ministerial body that Yin Zhuo envisaged.  The military now has a powerful civilian organization which will compete with the PLAN to defend China’s maritime sovereignty.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

This analysis suggests that the PLAN Lobby’s influence on Central Leadership decisionmaking is mixed.  In the Spratly case the PLAN Lobby was able to frame the issue as a military challenge which demanded a military response.  The PLAN Lobby’s effectiveness at obtaining the Leadership’s endorsement for an aircraft carrier was mixed.  The Lobby was unsuccessful in convincing the CCP leadership to acquire a carrier in the 1990s.  It took another CCP General Secretary (Hu Jintao) and a change in the international security environment before the Navy Lobby was successful.  More importantly, this case reaffirms that the Party retains the final word on matters of grand strategy and major budget decisions.  In this case the Party Central Leadership decided that Jiang Zemin’s “Peaceful Rise” outweighed the military need for a carrier.

The final vignette also brings to light some interesting findings.  The PLAN Lobby was not successful in obtaining Central Leadership authorization for central control.  This is likely because the civilian agencies involved argued for civilian centralization, and ultimately won the day.  Each of these agencies and their umbrella ministries represent civilian functions and are answerable to the State Council.  Centralization involving many agencies and ministries is not unheard of, however, making such an initiative a reality requires a substantial amount of time, bureaucratic horse trading, the expenditure of political capital, arrival at a consensus, and ultimately a decision at the highest levels of the PRC in favor of the proposal.

Although the PLAN exerts influence and can be an effective bureaucratic player, its mixed success in the cases examined above serve as a reminder that the CCP Leadership reserves for itself a monopoly on higher level strategic policymaking, major budgetary decisions, and the right to consider alternative points of view on military policy issues with broader strategic and foreign policy implications.

		<title>The Legal Rationale for Going Inside 12</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While China conducts innocent passage around real U.S. islands of Alaska, the U.S. is apparently unable to do so around China’s fake islands in the South China Sea. The transit by Chinese warships in innocent passage through the territorial sea of Attu Island in the Aleutian chain has added an additional wrinkle to U.S. policy in the South China Sea.

On May 12, the Wall Street Journal <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-military-proposes-challenge-to-china-sea-claims-1431463920">reported</a> that Secretary of Defense Ash Carter had asked his staff to “look at options” for exercising the rights and freedom of navigation and overflight in the EEZ, to include flying maritime patrol aircraft over China’s new artificial islands in the region, and sending U.S. warships to within 12 nautical miles of them. Later that month, a P-8 surveillance aircraft with a CNN crew on board, was repeatedly warned to “<a href="http://amti.csis.org/flight-of-the-poseidon-new-navy-footage-released/">go away quickly</a>” from Fiery Cross Reef, even as it flew beyond 12 nm from the feature. Fiery Cross Reef is a Chinese-occupied outcropping that has been fortified by a massive 2.7 million square meter land reclamation into an artificial island with a 3,110-meter airstrip and harbor works capable of servicing large warships.

Warships and commercial vessels of all nations are entitled to conduct transit in innocent passage in the territorial sea of a rock or island of a coastal state, although aircraft do not enjoy such a right. Ironically, the website POLITICO <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/barack-obama-administration-navy-pentagon-odds-south-china-sea-120865">reported</a> on July 31 that the White House blocked plans by Admiral Harry Harris, Commander, U.S. Pacific Command, to send warships within 12 nm of China’s artificial islands – features that may not even qualify for a territorial sea. By blocking such transits, military officials apparently suggest that the White House tacitly accepts China’s unlawful claim to control shipping around its occupied features in the South China Sea. Senator John McCain complained that the United States was making a “<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/barack-obama-administration-navy-pentagon-odds-south-china-sea-120865">dangerous mistake</a>” by granting de facto recognition of China’s man-made “sovereignty” claims.

It is unclear whether features like Fiery Cross Reef are rocks or merely low-tide elevations that are submerged at high tide, and after China has so radically transformed them, it may now be impossible to determine their natural state. Under the terms of the law of the sea, states with ownership over naturally formed rocks are entitled to claim a 12 nm territorial sea. On the other hand, low-tide elevations in the mid-ocean do not qualify for any maritime zone whatsoever. Likewise, artificial islands and installations also generate no maritime zones of sovereignty or sovereign rights in international law, although the owner of features may maintain a 500-meter vessel traffic management zone to ensure navigational safety.

Regardless of the natural geography of China’s occupied features in the South China Sea, China does not have clear legal title to them. Every feature occupied by China is challenged by another claimant state, often with clearer line of title from Spanish, British or French colonial rule. The nation, not the land, is sovereign, which is why there is no territorial sea around Antarctica – it is not under the sovereignty of any state, despite being a continent. As the United States has not recognized Chinese title to the features, it is not obligated to observe requirements of a theoretical territorial sea. Since the territorial sea is function of state sovereignty of each rock or island, and not a function of simple geography, if the United States does not recognize any state having title to the feature, then it is not obligated to observe a theoretical territorial sea and may treat the feature as <em>terra nullius</em>. Not only do U.S. warships have a right to transit within 12 nm of Chinese features, they are free to do so as an exercise of highs seas freedom under article 87 of the Law of the Sea Convention, rather than the more limited regime of innocent passage. Furthermore, whereas innocent passage does not permit overflight, high seas freedoms do, and U.S. naval aircraft lawfully may overfly such features.

In response, it might be suggested that while the United States may not recognize Chinese ownership of the rocks, it must realize that some country, perhaps one of the coastal states actually located in the vicinity of the feature, has lawful title, and therefore the U.S. Navy is bound to observe a putative territorial sea.

It is possible, however, that there is no state that has lawful title, and indeed the swirling debate and paucity of evidence rendered by claimants suggests this may be the case. Before World War II, few if any of the features were effectively governed by anyone, except Japan, which illegally occupied them during war. Tokyo gave up its claim after World War II. Similarly, actions taken by states after 1945 to seize maritime features using armed aggression are prima facie unlawful under article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations. Furthermore, actions taken by a state to fortify its claim after there is a dispute are similarly void of legal effect. In any event, the strongest claims appear to flow from the doctrine of <em>uti possidetis</em>, which stipulates that lawful possession is assumed by colonies after they become independent states. Prior to 1945, conquest was a lawful means of acquiring title to territory, so the European colonial powers certainly enjoyed legal title to the features they controlled. The Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei, Indonesia, and Vietnam derive their title to features from Spain, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and France.

More importantly, even assuming that one or another state may have lawful title to a feature, other states are not obligated to confer upon that nation the right to unilaterally adopt and enforce measures that interfere with navigation, until lawful title is resolved. Indeed, observing any nation’s rules pertaining to features under dispute legitimizes that country’s claim and takes sides. This point is particularly critical for commercial overflight since states already manage international air traffic through the International Civil Aviation Organization and the worldwide air traffic control regions. Finally, there is a policy reason that supports this approach. Given the proliferation of claims over the hundreds of rocks, reefs, skerries and cays in the South China Sea, if the international community recognizes the maximum theoretical rights generated by each of them, the oceans and airspace will come to look like Swiss cheese and be practically closed off to free navigation and overflight.

Distinguished American historian Samuel Flagg Bemis called the doctrine of freedom of the seas the “ancient birthright” of the American Republic.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> This birthright faces its gravest risk since unrestricted submarine warfare. Woodrow Wilson brought the United States into World War I to vindicate a Fourteen Point program for peace. Point number 2 was for “freedom of navigation … in peace and in war.” Similarly, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill signed the Atlantic Charter in 1941 that set forth principles for a new world order – a united nations. Principle Seven committed them to freedom of the seas. Maritime freedoms and the law of the sea are at an inflection point. The United States and the international community must take action now to operate with regularity on, under, and above the surface of the South China Sea, persistently and routinely in the vicinity of China’s artificial islands. Only a normalized presence today will ensure predictability and stability tomorrow.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Introducing our New AMTI Director: Greg Poling</h1>
<b>By Michael J. Green
Senior Vice President for Asia and Japan Chair, CSIS
Chairman of the Editorial Board, AMTI</b>

CSIS is proud to announce our first “hail and farewell” at AMTI. We began in 2013 with an idea for a multimedia platform to promote transparency in maritime Asia and were extremely fortunate to recruit Dr. Mira Rapp-Hooper to help design and implement the project. Under Mira’s leadership, AMTI has established a strong following among officials, scholars and journalists. It is no small feat building a program that is both authoritative and dynamic in such a short time, and we are all grateful to Mira for what she has achieved. We asked Mira to reflect on her work with AMTI, and have featured her insightful essay below. We look forward to her future contributions to the field as she pursues new scholarship and policy innovation in this next phase of her career.
CSIS is also delighted to announce that the new Director for AMTI will be our own Gregory Poling. Greg has been with CSIS since 2012, leading research projects for the Sumitro Chair for Southeast Asia Studies and the Pacific Partners Initiative. Greg is the creator of South China Sea in High Resolution, an innovative policy tool combining geospatial data and multimedia to build presentations about the South China Sea that was part of the initial inspiration for AMTI. He brings extensive expertise and contacts on Southeast Asia and the South China Sea and is frequently cited in domestic and international press and has written for outlets including the Wall Street Journal, Nikkei Asian Review, Journal of Political Risk, and YaleGlobal. Greg has also authored a series of assessments of the challenges in the South China Sea, including: Grappling with the South China Sea Policy Challenge (August 2015), Recent Trends in the South China Sea and U.S. Policy (July 2014), and The South China Sea in Focus: Clarifying the Limits of Maritime Dispute (July 2013), along with publications on U.S. relations with Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.
In his first week on the job, Greg has already helped us to produce new imagery and analysis on China’s reclamation and construction on four features in the South China Sea, which was previewed in the Washington Post and will be available on the AMTI site soon. Greg will be adding new innovations, areas of analysis, and media platforms in the months ahead as we continue working for greater transparency and policy exchange on maritime security across Asia.
<h1>Lessons Learned from a Year at AMTI</h1>
<b>By Mira Rapp-Hooper</b>

It has been quite an eventful inaugural year for the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative. CSIS’s leadership began with an idea to establish a website that would act as a public lens through which to examine maritime and territorial issues in the Asia-Pacific region. AMTI would serve as an objective resource for data and would help to dissuade the use of coercion and promote cooperation in the region. Since its launch, the project has shifted shape as events in maritime Asia have unfolded. As I prepare to depart from CSIS, I am honored to have the opportunity to share just three of the many lessons I have learned while at the helm of AMTI.

Facts Do Have a Voice. Because CSIS wanted to create an objective platform for information, we knew that it was vital that the project not take positions on the region’s long-simmering sovereignty disputes, or privilege the narrative of any particular claimant. This type of scholarly neutrality certainly has a place in academic books and articles, but would it work on a website? So often, web traffic is driven by salacious headlines and polemic arguments. I worried that we would have trouble finding an audience that was interested in “just the facts”—particularly given how contentious maritime and territorial disputes can be. We quickly learned, however, that there was a broad appetite for reliable information in this space. AMTI’s most successful features have consistently been those that are comparative and data-rich: our special issue on airpower and airstrips in the South China Sea, or our Island Tracker page, for example. Facts do speak for themselves.

The Old Adage is True… A picture is worth at least 1,000 words! We designed the AMTI website with the hope that we could contribute to the policy debate by helping our users to visualize what exactly was at stake in maritime Asia. At the project’s inception, this meant creating original maps and novel infographics, but we did not foresee just how important visuals would become. As the expert community grew increasingly concerned about land reclamation in the South China Sea, we looked for ways to make this uncommon and esoteric issue accessible to a broader audience. Our partnership with DigitalGlobe has been one of the most exciting parts of the project so far. Because of the availability of commercial satellite imagery, developments that take place at sea can be seen around the world in a matter of days, and can facilitate and focus objective analysis and policy discourse. This relationship between imagery and policy has applications far beyond the Asia-Pacific region. Wherever pressing political issues involve change over time to a land feature, body of water, or visible structure, open-source imagery can make clear and accessible otherwise-inscrutable phenomena.

Transparency is Welcome…and not Just in Washington… AMTI’s mission depends on buy-in from scholars, government officials, and the general public in Asia. Perhaps the most rewarding part of my job has been the opportunity to work with leading scholars in the region to produce AMTI’s biweekly analysis. These thought-leaders have consistently used their subject matter expertise and national perspectives to advance the global policy debate and have taught me a great deal in the process. I have also been privileged to work with officials from numerous governments in the region, as they have reached out to AMTI to contribute policy documents to our Documents Library, in an effort to help our users understand the region’s complex maritime history. Finally, I have been thrilled to see AMTI develop a significant regional user base. While a substantial portion of AMTI readers hail from the United States, almost as many are based in China. The website also has a sizeable following in the Philippines, Vietnam, Japan, Australia, Singapore, and India, despite the fact that it is only available in English. The need for confidence-building agreements is as acute as it has ever been, but deep regional engagement at all three of these levels gives one hope for the future of dispute management—particularly those mechanisms that have a central role for transparency and information-sharing.

As I bid farewell to AMTI, I am grateful to my friends and colleagues at CSIS who helped to build, support, and maintain this project with great skill and passion. In particular, Mike Green’s leadership and commitment to AMTI’s mission has been formidable. As AMTI enters its next phase, I know that the project will continue evolve and to respond to regional events in innovative ways. I am grateful to have been a part of this dynamic project for its first year of life and look forward to seeing where the quest for regional transparency takes AMTI next.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[President Xi Jinping arrived in Seattle today for the first leg of a week-long trip to the United States. The Chinese president will visit Washington, DC, on September 24-25 for meetings with President Barack Obama, congressional leaders, and others before proceeding to New York, where he will address the United Nations on September 28.

On last week’s CogitAsia Podcast, CSIS Freeman Chair in China Studies Christopher Johnson looked ahead to President Xi’s visit and the state of U.S.-China relations, including how thorny issues like the South China Sea disputes and cybersecurity will be tackled.

		<title>Xi’s Visit to Cool Down the South China Sea</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On President Xi Jinping’s first state visit to the United States this week, the South China Sea might be low on his list of topics for discussion. Access for Chinese investment in the United States, coordination on monetary policies, and even climate change will likely be far higher on President Xi’s agenda.

The decades-old South China Sea disputes have risen to a boil in recent years, which from the Chinese perspective does not serve anyone’s interests. Beijing is busy fighting a slackening economy and intransigent bureaucracy at home, while also trying to sell its “One Belt, One Road” strategy in Southeast Asia. Meanwhile China sees other South China Sea claimants struggling to sustain their own economic momentum. The South China Sea disputes could hamper these efforts if it takes up too much of decision-makers’ energy.

Chinese officials announced the completion of land reclamation work in the Spratly (<em>Nansha</em>) Islands in June, meaning any future installations will be restricted to the seven features China currently occupies in the Spratlys. The contentious reclamation work, which started in late 2013, was mainly an outcome of China’s assessment of its own relative position in the South China Sea.

The Communist government inherited China’s claim over the South China Sea from the Nationalists in 1949. This claim encompasses all land features in the sea, as well an undefined maritime claim covering most of the South China Sea. Cross-strait competition between the mainland and Taiwan for authority and legitimacy during the Cold War left Beijing no space for compromise, leading it to stick to its inherited claim even today. From the Chinese perspective, the “nine-dash line” went largely unchallenged from 1947 – 47 years before the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea entered into force – until recent years.

Since 2012, two developments occurred against the backdrop of the U.S. pivot, or rebalance, to Asia and became catalysts for China’s decision to launch its land reclamation. First was the April 2012 Scarborough Shoal skirmish between China and the Philippines, which led to the Philippine decision in 2013 to bring a case against Beijing’s South China Sea claims before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. Second was Japan’s “nationalization” of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands in September 2012, which resulted in anti-Japanese riots in major Chinese cities.

With tensions running high, the major reason given by proponents of the reclamation work seemed unassailable to Chinese policymakers: China gets nothing in return for exercising self-restraint when other claimants have already engaged in reclamation. China sees other claimants as consolidating their occupation of features in the Spratlys, eroding Chinese sovereignty and presenting a danger that China could forever lose its territories. Given this self-justifying rationale and the perception of a seemingly irreversible trend toward intervention by “external forces” – a substitutive term for the United States – China deems its land reclamation a countermeasure to retain sovereignty and seek a superior position to dissuade other claimants. But China is not willing to cross one line: taking land features from other claimants by force as it did in 1974 and 1988.

With the completion of reclamation, the focus has shifted to the construction of installations. The preparation of airstrips and hangars on reclaimed features has raised concern that China is preparing to declare a South China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). The prospect of China threatening freedom of navigation via an ADIZ weighs on the minds of major South China Sea users’ minds, including those of Australia, Japan, the United States, and some ASEAN countries. This perception indicates the fundamental dilemma that in a contested maritime domain, international law is not sufficient to both set the rules of the road and manage competition for prestige.

Given its perceived status as a rising power, and having studied the history of major powers’ rises, China has decided not to take part in the arbitration case brought by the Philippines, but is willing to open its reclaimed features to use by others for the “international public good.” China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson has said on several occasions that the reclaimed features will be opened to international cooperation on “search and rescue, meteorological observation, and safety of navigation, and so on” if and when “the time is ripe.” One can therefore assume that during discussion of the South China Sea in Washington, President Xi will seek to emphasize China’s respect for and potential provision of public goods, and U.S.-China coordination on limiting differences. In short, Xi will seek to lower the temperature, but whether he will be successful and what will happen afterward remain question marks.

The “Great Wall of Sand,” as commander of the U.S. Pacific Command Adm. Harry Harris called China’s reclaimed features, has already been established and it is hard to imagine any change of control without conflict. No matter what cost China pays for its reclamation, or how much other claimants build up their holdings, the United States provides assistance to boost coastal states’ maritime capacity, or U.S. military forces are redeployed, one cannot turn back the clock. China deems its actions “lawful,” or at least commensurate with what others have been doing. The key to resolution lies in strategic thinking on the issue.

Opening facilities on its reclaimed features to civilian use as a “public good” would signal that China is fully aware of the significance of freedom of navigation as the largest user of the South China Sea, and that it is committed to avoiding the “tragedy of great power politics” that has greeted a rising power throughout history. The South China Sea is a real test for the trajectory of China’s rise and relations with the United States, and President Xi’s first state visit could be the beginning of an exchange of strategic thinking toward ensuring a rules-based coevolution.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Asia: All Eyes on the Obama-Xi Summit</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[President Xi Jinping’s ongoing nine-day trip to the United States is his first state visit to the country. He is being greeted with a 21-gun salute and attendant formalities and honors, but he is no stranger to his hosts. In 2013, he held a special informal summit with President Barack Obama at Sunnylands estate in California. Historically, such meetings were reserved for statesmen from the United States’ closest and most loyal allies, such as Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi’s 2006 private meeting with George W. Bush in Graceland or British prime minister David Cameron's sojourn with Obama in 2012.

Framing U.S. ties with China as “the most important bilateral relationship in the world,” the Obama administration in 2013 displayed its renewed commitment to a robust bilateral engagement with Beijing. It offered a more “personal touch” to improve rapport between the heads of the world’s two most powerful nations. Although Obama openly admitted to “areas of tension” between the two countries, he studiously tried to emphasize areas of common concern, particularly in the realm of international trade, climate change, and cybersecurity.

This time around, however, there will be expectations that Obama and other U.S. officials will be more forthcoming and steadfast in trying to dissuade China from further provocative actions, including in maritime disputes in the East and South China seas. The legacy of Obama’s pivot, or rebalance, to Asia could very well be defined by this.

<strong>Areas of Potential Cooperation</strong>

<strong> </strong>By all indications, cybersecurity will serve as a key theme during Xi’s visit to Washington. In recent years, the Obama administration has gone out of its way to accuse elements in China of engaging in <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-charges-six-chinese-citizens-with-economic-espionage-1432046527">corporate cyber-espionage</a> and outright theft of sensitive military information, including <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/19/world/china-us-f35-fighter-denial/">designs of advanced aircrafts</a>, from the Pentagon. The personal records of up to <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/china/21665034-xi-jinpings-state-visit-washington-will-do-little-resolve-growing-tensions-very-long">22 million</a> U.S. government employees have been allegedly hacked by Chinese elements. But there are signs of a potential Sino-American thaw on the issue.

During his visit this week to Seattle with Chinese business executives, Xi <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/world/asia/xi-jinping-of-china-to-address-wary-us-business-leaders.html?_r=0">declared</a> that China “will not in whatever form engage in commercial theft, and hacking against [other nation’s] government networks,” calling for punishment of cybercrimes in accordance with “relevant international treaties.” As the highlight of the summit, Xi and Obama are expected to <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2985089/us-china-appear-close-on-cyber-economic-espionage-deal.html">sign a deal</a> on corporate cyber-espionage, paving the way for a more comprehensive agreement on common rules of the road in the realm of cyber technology.

Obviously the United States has other major concerns, with economics and climate change also expected to dominate the summit. As <a href="http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/25417/chinas_carbon_emissions_report_2015.html">the world’s leading source</a> of carbon emissions, China is essential to any international effort at climate change mitigation, while Beijing’s recent decision to <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/08/china-economy-reality-150815165145072.html">devalue its currency</a> has raised concerns over a new round of currency wars.

The Obama administration will surely focus on constructive engagement with China, exploring various mechanisms to manage tension and optimize areas of shared interests. On leading international security issues such as the Iranian nuclear program, China has played a positive role in brokering the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which most experts consider a trailblazing anti-proliferation agreement. And there are hopes that China will also aid international efforts at reining in North Korean belligerence. With respect to territorial and maritime disputes in the Western Pacific, however, Washington and China seem to have reached a deadlock.

<strong>Limits of Engagement </strong>

In 2013, Xi tried to signal China’s goodwill toward the United States by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-22798572">claiming</a>, "The vast Pacific Ocean has enough space for two large countries like the United States and China." Controversially, he also called <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/11/old-type-great-power-relations/">for a</a> “new model of great power relations.” Against the backdrop of rising territorial tensions in the Western Pacific, the statements reflected Beijing’s efforts to find a new <em>modus vivendi</em> with Washington on China’s terms.

U.S. allies such as Japan and the Philippines, which have been caught in bitter territorial and maritime disputes with China, quietly lamented Washington’s decision to eschew mention of the East and South China Sea disputes in formal statements. From their perspective, China was pushing for a <em>de facto </em>co-dominion with the United States in the Western Pacific, ostensibly at the expense of the territorial interests of smaller claimants in the area. Since the Sunnylands meeting, China has upped the ante by expanding reclamation activities in disputed areas and gradually establishing a sprawling network of advanced airstrips and military installations in the Paracel and Spratly island chains.

Since December 2013, China has reclaimed <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/21/us-southchinasea-china-pentagon-idUSKCN0QQ0S920150821">about 2,900 acres</a> of land in the Spratlys, functionally (if not legally) transforming rocks and submerged atolls into full-fledged islands, with artificially-improved Fiery Cross, Mischief, and Subi reefs <a href="http://amti.csis.org/new-imagery-release/">poised to host</a> large airstrips that could support robust military operations in the area. China will soon be in a position to project power from these artificially-created islands. There is growing concern in the region that China is already establishing the skeleton of an Air Defense Identification Zone in the South China Sea, which will threaten freedom of (civilian and military) overflight above some of the world’s most important sea lines of communication.

There are real fears that China will progressively tighten the noose around the supply-lines of other claimant states in the Spratlys. Allies such as the Philippines have accused China of <a href="http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/09/philippines-feels-harrassed-by-china/">imposing restrictions</a> on its reconnaissance and resupply missions in the area, while Filipino troops stationed on Second Thomas Shoal have been confronting an on-again off-again Chinese blockade since 2013.

There is a grave sense of urgency, if not panic, among U.S. allies and partners in the face of Chinese assertiveness in the East and South China seas. Allies in Asia will anxiously watch whether the summit will pave the way for any tangible improvement in the situation and how forcefully Obama will raise the issue with his Chinese counterpart, who has adamantly opposed any U.S. involvement in the disputes. The pivot to Asia is after all about reaffirming the United States’ role as the anchor of stability in Asia.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Eugenio Bito-onon, mayor of Thitu Island (Pag-asa in Filipino), recently sat down with CSIS Sumitro Chair for Southeast Asia Studies senior fellow and deputy director Murray Hiebert to discuss China’s island reclamation efforts in the South China Sea, his encounters with Chinese Coast Guard vessels in disputed waters, and the mayor’s proposal to develop an eco-tourism zone in the Spratly Islands. Thitu is the largest of the Philippine-occupied features in the Spratly Islands and is home to about 100 Filipino civilians. The interview originally appeared as part of the Sumitro Chair’s Dialog series, <a href="http://csis.org/multimedia/dialog-eugenio-bito-onon-jr-mayor-pagasa-island-philippines">here</a>.

		<title>The Bangladesh/Myanmar Maritime Dispute: Lessons for Peaceful Resolution</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The March 2012 decision of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) in the long-standing Bangladesh/Myanmar maritime border dispute opened up new possibilities for peaceful resolution of such disputes in Asia. While the <a href="https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no_16/C16_Judgment_14_03_2012_rev.pdf">judgment</a> itself broke important—if technical—legal ground, the two parties’ incentives for entering into litigation in the first place offer equally valuable lessons for future disputes.

Bangladesh and Myanmar were driven to seek the tribunal’s opinion because both realized that continued uncertainty over their maritime boundary was worse than almost any award the judges might realistically grant. The undefined status of the continental shelf in the northeastern Bay of Bengal was <a href="http://www.nbr.org/publications/asia_policy/Preview/AP10_D_Maritime_preview.pdf">scaring away</a> international investors and energy companies who would otherwise have jumped at the chance to explore potentially vast new natural gas fields. The dispute cast a pall over the whole region; energy companies were reluctant to invest even in areas far from the disputed waters. And since any ruling was likely to leave each country with some of the area believed to hold gas deposits, both were able to accept the risk of submitting to a neutral arbiter.

This is a reminder of the rather obvious—it is easier to convince both parties in a dispute to submit to third-party resolution when the result is likely to objectively benefit both. The tribunal’s judgment was accepted with some degree of warmth by both sides (each of whom could <a href="https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/bitstream/handle/10220/7882/RSIS0482012.pdf?sequence=1">plausibly</a> claim that it had “won” the case). Even more importantly, the decision has stuck; the two states have not returned to conflict and have instead been <a href="http://www.irrawaddy.org/natural-resources/burma-and-bangladesh-in-battle-of-the-bengal-bay-gas-blocks.html">competing</a> to offer the most favorable terms to international energy companies interested in natural gas deposits in the Bay of Bengal.

The case had its origins equally in law and politics. Bangladesh’s long, concave coastline makes maritime boundary disputes almost inevitable. Under a standard application of maritime boundary law, the intersecting arcs of India’s and Myanmar’s 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zones (EEZs) would cut off Bangladesh’s access to the continental shelf and leave it with a disproportionately small EEZ relative to the length of its coastline. As a result Myanmar and Bangladesh made competing claims to a section of ocean and seabed extending southwest in a widening sliver from the seaward terminus of their land border.

<a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Bangladesh1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4007" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Bangladesh1.jpg" alt="Bangladesh1" width="669" height="812" /></a>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Sketch map composed by ITLOS illustrating the competing claims of Bangladesh (green) and Myanmar (red).</em></p>
The two countries had irreconcilable views of their respective maritime boundaries but the dispute largely remained on the back burner until late 2008, when South Korea’s Daewoo, at the behest of Myanmar, began natural gas exploration in waters claimed by Bangladesh. A few weeks later, Bangladesh submitted its continental shelf claim to the United Nations’ Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. The public declaration was a stark reminder of Bangladesh’s and Myanmar’s conflicting claims in the area. Both countries mobilized naval forces in the disputed area and the conflict <a href="http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Articles/Detail/?lang=en&amp;id=93998">narrowly</a> escaped escalation.

ITLOS had never before ruled on a maritime boundary dispute and its perceived neutrality and status as a blank slate increased the two countries’ willingness to submit the case to the tribunal. As the National Bureau for Asian Research’s <a href="http://www.nbr.org/publications/asia_policy/Preview/AP10_D_Maritime_preview.pdf">Jared Bissinger</a> makes clear, Bangladesh hoped that considerations of equity would persuade the court to employ relatively untested methods of boundary delimitation. Myanmar, for its part, was confident that the application of the traditional principle of equidistance would lead to a favorable result, and that the court would avoid ruling on the issue of the continental shelf and focus solely on dividing up waters within 200 nautical miles of shore. Thus both sides believed they had a winning case—a strong incentive to seek legal redress.

In the end the tribunal chose, quite literally, a middle path. It modified the boundary that would have resulted from the equidistance approach (which sets the maritime boundary between two states by drawing a line equidistant from a series of “base points” on each state’s coastline) in order to avoid cutting off Bangladesh from the outer reaches of its EEZ. The resulting line was almost exactly in the center of the boundaries proposed by Bangladesh and Myanmar.

The ruling was noteworthy in part for the court’s decision that it had jurisdiction to decide not only competing claims to waters but also the continental shelf, and for the creation of a “grey area” that is on Bangladesh’s side of the boundary line drawn by the court but within the potential 200-nautical-mile EEZ of Myanmar. In this grey area, Bangladesh controls the seabed but Myanmar the superjacent waters. Similar grey areas have since been created by other bodies, including in the Permanent Court of Arbitration’s July 2014 ruling on the <a href="http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage5a3b.html?pag_id=1376">India/Bangladesh boundary dispute</a>. The grey area is the result of the tribunal’s concern for an equitable resolution of the dispute. In this case, allowing Myanmar to claim the seabed in the grey area—to which it would normally be entitled—would cut Bangladesh off from a much larger section of its own continental shelf.

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Sketch map composed by ITLOS illustrating the “grey area” in which Bangladesh has jurisdiction over the seabed but Myanmar’s has jurisdiction over the water.</em></p>
Equally important was the court’s treatment of St. Martin’s Island, a small island belonging to Bangladesh but located directly west of Myanmar. The Tribunal gave full effect to the island when delimiting the two countries’ territorial seas, but did not allow Bangladesh to use the island as a base point when marking the equidistance line between the two states’ EEZs and continental shelves. The decision also minimized the island’s importance by declining to identify it as a “relevant circumstance” that should be considered when making adjustments to the boundary line.

<em> </em>The treatment of St. Martin’s island came in for strong criticism in the separate opinion of Judge Zhiguo Gao, China’s appointee on the tribunal, who <a href="https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no_16/C16.sep_op.Gao.rev.Ewith_maps.pdf">described</a> the decision to give full effect to the island in delimiting the territorial seas but to ignore it in delimiting the EEZ and continental shelf boundaries as “wrong and unacceptable.” Gao argued that the result was unfair to Bangladesh and that the island should be given half effect in delimiting the larger maritime boundary. In his dissenting opinion, he gave special weight to the island’s degree of economic development, the size of its population, and its closeness to the mainland—implying that in his view not all islands are created equal for maritime boundary delimitation purposes. This debate over St. Martin’s has far reaching implications for small islands in disputed waters elsewhere in Asia.

Unfortunately the tribunal’s success in attracting this relatively low-stakes case might actually diminish larger powers’ willingness to submit to its judgment. ITLOS is no longer a blank slate onto which both parties can project their hoped-for outcomes. Its decisions on maritime boundary disputes, together with those of other bodies, are evolving into an established body of jurisprudence on the subject. Parties to disputes increasingly have at least a general idea of what the outcome of their case might be, and they are unlikely to enter into litigation if they might not like the result.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Japan-Taiwan Fishery Agreement: Strategic Success, Tactical Failure?</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Japan and Taiwan concluded a civil fishery agreement in April 2013. It took 17 years to conclude the agreement with occasional interruption of the negotiations. The agreement covers the waters south of 27 degrees north latitude and north of the Yaeyama Islands, excluding the territorial seas around the disputed Senkaku (Diaoyutai) Islands, over which both Japan and Taiwan claim sovereignty. Under the agreement, Japanese and Taiwanese fishing boats in the area are exempted from the jurisdiction of each other’s law enforcement, and the two sides agreed to discuss resource conservation and common fishing rules.

The agreement was a strategic success for both Japan and Taiwan. Taiwan strongly protested against the September 2012 transfer of ownership of three Senkaku Islands from their private owner to the Japanese government by dispatching a large fishing fleet to the waters around the islands. Tokyo grew concerned about a possible Beijing-Taipei unified campaign against Japan’s claim over the islands. In order to prevent such unity of purpose, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe demonstrated strong leadership in concluding the fishery agreement with Taiwan.

Meanwhile President Ma Ying-jeou advocated for an “East China Sea Peace Initiative,” calling for all sides to shelve sovereignty issues, seek peaceful resolution, and jointly develop resources in disputed waters. Ma did not insist upon recognition of Taiwan’s territorial claim during the negotiations, and thus differentiated Taipei’s approach from that of Beijing, which physically challenged Japanese sovereignty by sending coast guard ships within the territorial waters around the islands. As a result, Ma demonstrated Taiwan’s presence and influence in regional issues.

Tokyo and Taipei set a precedent for managing territorial disputes while avoiding further escalation of bilateral tensions in the East China Sea. This could provide a good example for claimants to the South China Sea disputes.

But local fishermen in Okinawa do not necessarily welcome the civil fishery agreement. Taiwanese fishing boats were already allowed to operate in the waters south of 27 degrees north latitude under a 2000 Japan-China fishery agreement. Following the conclusion of that agreement, differing fishing customs and operations led to trouble between Japanese and Taiwanese fishermen, which the latter blame on aggressive practices by Taiwanese operators. The Japan-Taiwan fishery agreement left fishermen in Okinawa dissatisfied that their concerns were not taken into account during the negotiations, and they remain reluctant to operate in the waters covered by the agreement for fear of run-ins with Taiwanese fishermen.

The Japan-Taiwan civil fishery agreement provides a basis for establishing common rules for fishing and dispute settlement. The two sides have been developing such rules under the Japan-Taiwan Fishery Committee. However, the rule-making process is not going well due to different fishing cultures. As a result, Japanese fishing boats refrain from operating in the presence of Taiwanese fishing boats.

The fishery agreement might have satisfied the strategic interests of both Tokyo and Taipei, but its long-term success depends on the support of local fishermen. Japan and Taiwan need to cooperate more on the common rulemaking for safe fishing and the implementation of regulations to make the fishery agreement a real success.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[China has nine maritime neighbors (including Taiwan) but no settled maritime boundaries, due in part to China’s unwillingness to specify its maritime claims. Only one partial exception to this imprecision exists: a <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%202336/v2336.pdf">boundary agreement</a> with Vietnam to delimit the northern part of the Gulf of Tonkin and a fishery agreement establishing a joint fishing regime in that area, both reached in 2000.

The agreements offer both positive and negative lessons. At a minimum, they provide important precedents that should be more widely appreciated – foremost among them that it is <em>possible </em>for China to come to the bargaining table on maritime disputes. Meanwhile specific lessons can be applied to China’s bilateral maritime disputes with Japan, Vietnam, and the Koreas. Unfortunately the Tonkin agreements support only modest expectations for resolution of the complex, multilateral Spratly Islands disputes.

First, the good news:
<ol>
	<li><em>The Tonkin agreements might have enabled future deals.</em> Leaders in both China and Vietnam authorized their diplomats to negotiate formal boundaries governing about 36,000 square nautical miles of productive fisheries and potentially lucrative hydrocarbons. The deal emerged from three separate rounds of negotiation (1974, 1978-1979, and 1992-2000), with the last being a whole-of-government effort featuring input from senior party leaders, provincial governments, various stakeholder agencies, and technical and scientific experts. Importantly, growing familiarity between negotiators did not breed contempt – rather, it helped establish organizational and individual connections that were indispensable to the final settlement. Wang Yi, the current PRC foreign minister, was China’s lead negotiator and presumably knows what is required, politically and organizationally, to achieve future settlements. Comparable, substantial investment of official time and political energy is possible and necessary for future deals.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
	<li><em>China made significant compromises.</em> The 21 geographic points constituting the Sino-Vietnamese boundary in the Gulf of Tonkin divide it into two unequal parts, with 53.23 percent of the water lying on the Vietnamese side of the line. This compromise by China reflects the relative length of the Vietnamese coastline and the position of Bach Long Vi Island. That island was once the subject of a Sino-Vietnamese sovereignty dispute put to rest in 1957 when Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai dropped the Chinese claim. That strong Chinese leaders were once willing to make a deal over sovereignty that later facilitated a boundary resolution is a valuable precedent.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
	<li><em>UNCLOS provided guidelines, but was not determinative.</em> The conclusive round of Sino-Vietnamese negotiations (1992-2000) was facilitated by the parties’ informal agreement in 1993 that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) would furnish the basic principles to be applied to resolving maritime boundary disputes. They also agreed that international practice, equity, and relevant circumstances would be given appropriate weight in negotiations. The parties did not use their respective interpretations of the law of the sea as take-it-or-leave-it demands for comprehensive settlement. Rather, international law furnished several focal points for the two parties (who had not yet even ratified UNCLOS) to cooperate and delimit their respective territorial seas, exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and continental shelves. This nuanced approach to legal norms allowed them to reach agreement even while “shelving” pesky problems such as rights over non-living resources like oil and gas.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
	<li><em>The agreement gave partial effect to islands and reduced maritime entitlements.</em> The states’ overlapping EEZs in the area were given less than the maximum 200 nautical miles prescribed in UNCLOS. Further, Vietnam’s Bach Long Vi and Con Co Islands were given 25 percent and 50 percent effect, respectively, in drawing the demarcation line for those EEZs. This compromise established an immensely valuable precedent for future negotiations over Chinese maritime boundaries in the East and South China Seas. Partial effects would be especially valuable in the bilateral dispute with Japan over the Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands, which lie at the very southern end of a long potential maritime boundary and could be effectively ignored in delimitation. This move might prove even more useful in the bilateral dispute with Vietnam over the Paracel Islands, where mutual agreement to reduce (or ignore) entitlements for the Paracels would allow extension of the Tonkin demarcation line through that disputed area without addressing the question of sovereignty over the islands.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
	<li><em>Domestic objections did not scuttle the deal.</em> Nationalist sentiments ran high in both China and Vietnam after the deal was announced. The four-year lag between the parties’ signing the agreements (2000) and putting them into effect (2004) is partly attributable to public protests, media criticism, and bureaucratic resistance to the compromises on both sides. Leaders in both countries mustered the political will to conclude the deal in spite of strong domestic objections, and could do so again if they truly wanted to.</li>
</ol>
Now for the bad news.
<ol>
	<li><em>The boundary agreement covers only a small area.</em> Though better than envisioned in the original talks, which covered about one third of the maritime space eventually delimited, the roughly 300-mile line eventually established bisects only a small fraction of the disputed area. No official talks about extending the line have been reported, and <a href="http://amti.csis.org/oil-rig-981-friction-in-the-south-china-sea/">subsequent practice</a> south of the delimited area has not been cooperative.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
	<li><em>The agreement did not involve disputed features.</em> Notwithstanding the 1957 Chinese concession on Bach Long Vi, China and Vietnam established their maritime boundary in the Tonkin Gulf by neglecting (both geographically and diplomatically) complex issues arising from sovereignty disputes. Although the “partial effects” precedent can mitigate that complexity and narrow the scope of disputed zones, the fact remains that China would need to muster significantly greater political courage to even <em>begin </em>talks that might touch upon its “indisputable” sovereignty claims over features in the South and East China Seas.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
	<li><em>Implementation of the fishery agreement is iffy.</em> The Tonkin boundary agreement is permanent and requires no implementation, but the fisheries agreement has a 12-year lifespan (and a 3-year automatic extension), and must be constantly upheld in practice if it is to be meaningful. Based on limited reporting, implementation has not been an overwhelming success. The effectiveness of an international maritime boundary depends largely on the activities of vessels, especially private fishing vessels, from both sides. Judging from collapsing fish stocks in the South China Sea, rampant illegal fishing, and frequent conflicts between law enforcement and private fishermen from China and Vietnam, the agreement’s terms are still mostly aspirational. The only permanent organ established by China and Vietnam to manage implementation is a Joint Fishery Committee tasked with managing a Common Fisheries Zone. It meets once or twice per year to consult on conservation and utilization of fishery resources, but has had little verifiable success in making fisheries and law enforcement cooperation the norm in the delimited area.</li>
	<li><em>The agreed boundary relied on a historical treaty not a generic principle .</em> The delimitation line in the Tonkin agreement does not strictly apply any standard that can be replicated for other disputed boundaries. The agreed boundary does not appear to be based on an equidistant line between the two coasts, but rather on an 1887 Sino-French treaty that provided a mutually agreeable starting point for delimitation. Unfortunately, given the ambiguity of the post–World War II disposition of islands in the East China Sea and the existence of multiple, contradictory historical bases for claims in the South China Sea, the “historical treaty” precedent is inapplicable to outstanding disputes.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
	<li><em>Sino-Vietnamese diplomatic relations are more robust than others. </em>In spite of deep historical distrust between China and Vietnam, the long-standing relationship between their respective Communist parties greatly aided the negotiation process. By contrast, China’s diplomacy with Japan is badly under-institutionalized and frequently interrupted by nationalism and other domestic pathologies. The intensive, institutionalized negotiations required for successful boundary agreements would pose a special problem in that deeply fraught bilateral relationship. So too with the Philippines, toward which China is <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1217147.shtml">particularly negative</a> after Manila launched arbitration proceedings that Beijing considers illegitimate. Negotiations with Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia would present less severe diplomatic obstacles, but any settlement with them would require negotiations with other, less amenable parties to be practically meaningful.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
	<li><em>China was in a more compromising mood in the 1990s.</em> Between 1991 and 1999, China signed 11 boundary agreements that fully or partially settled seven disputes along its land borders. One of those was the Chinese land boundary with Vietnam, with which the maritime boundary agreement was associated. Unfortunately for China’s neighbors, that compromising mood is only a fond memory. Today China appears less vulnerable and more confrontational than in the wake of the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and the diplomatic isolation that followed the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Nationalism concerning the East and South China Sea disputes is not new, nor is it necessarily <a href="http://perthusasia.edu.au/usac/assets/media/docs/publications/2014_Exploring_Chinas_Maritime_Consciousness_Final.pdf">more virulent</a> or uncompromising, but China’s position has hardened and its capacity to enforce its claims and dictate terms of future settlements has increased.</li>
</ol>
On balance, the Sino-Vietnamese boundary and fishery agreements are a promising sign that China is capable of substantial compromise in maritime disputes. The agreements established several precedents that ought to be remembered and publicized. Modesty about the agreements’ wider applicability is also necessary. Still, Chinese leaders and experts, in particular, should be encouraged to review the diligent process and salutary outcome of that earlier era of diplomatic compromise as they set out to stabilize China’s troubled maritime frontier and secure a peaceful rise.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The U.S. Asserts Freedom of Navigation in the South China Sea</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After months of internal debate within the Obama administration, the guided missile destroyer USS <em>Lassen</em>transited within 12 nautical miles of Subi Reef, one of China’s artificially-built features in the South China Sea, on October 27 in what is termed a “freedom of navigation” (FON) operation. It was accompanied by two maritime surveillance aircraft, a P-8A Poseidon and a P-3 Orion.

<strong>Q1: What was the purpose of the operation?</strong>

<strong>A1: </strong>FON operations are intended to challenge maritime claims that the United States considers excessive under international law. The U.S. military has been conducting these operations regularly all over the world since 1979; in 2014 U.S. forces used FON operations to contest claims made by most of the South China Sea claimants, including China. However, the United States has not conducted FON operations inside 12 nautical miles of any feature in the South China Sea since 2012, according to Assistant Secretary of Defense David Shear. This particular operation was intended to assert that the United States does not recognize a 12-nautical-mile territorial sea or any other maritime entitlements generated by reefs that were originally submerged but on which China has built artificial islands. It was not meant to challenge China’s claim to Subi Reef itself.

FON operations are not primarily about military deterrence or diplomatic messaging, though in a politically charged atmosphere like the South China Sea those play a role. At its root, FON operations are legal exercises to reinforce the United States’—and in this case the overwhelming majority of the international community’s—interpretations of international maritime law. They are a means to ensure that U.S. naval, coast guard, and civilian ships, and by extension those of all nations, maintain unrestricted access to their rights at sea. In this particular case, the United States also needed to demonstrate its commitment to freedom of navigation as regional allies and partners had grown concerned in the wake of China’s massive island building and construction of potential military facilities <a href="http://amti.csis.org/spratlys-airstrip-update-is-mischief-reef-next/">including airstrips</a> in the Spratlys.

The U.S. government takes no position on the territorial disputes in the Spratly Islands, but does take a strong position on what kinds of claims are made to the waters surrounding those features. The United States shares the concerns of regional states that the intentional ambiguity of China’s claims to vast stretches of water and seabed are a leading driver of tensions in the South China Sea. U.S. officials regularly call on all parties to the dispute to bring their claims into accordance with international law. The FON operation around Subi is part of that overall strategy—it is a practical demonstration that the United States will not accede to maritime claims that violate international law, and it places pressure on China’s leaders to give a legal rationale for their objections to the operation.

<strong>Q2: Has China claimed a territorial sea around Subi Reef?</strong>

<strong>A2: </strong>China has been deliberately ambiguous about its claims to waters in the South China Sea. Although it has not specified exactly what its claim is around each of the built-up rocks or low-tide elevations in the Spratlys, China’s 1992 law on the territorial sea claims 12-nautical-mile territorial waters from all Chinese territory without distinction. In addition, the Chinese foreign ministry has implied that China claims territorial sovereignty over waters and airspace surrounding submerged reefs. In a statement on October 9, a foreign ministry spokesperson said that China does not “condone infringement of China’s territorial sea and airspace by any country under the pretext of maintaining freedom of navigation and overflight.” People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) ships have warned U.S. surveillance aircraft flying near its artificial islands, including Subi Reef, to stay away from its undefined “military alert zone.”

<strong>Q3: How has China reacted to the FON operation?</strong>

<strong>A3: </strong>Two PLAN vessels, the <em>Lanzhou</em> (a Type 052C missile destroyer) and <em>Taizhou</em> (a Type 053 frigate), shadowed the<em>Lassen</em> and issued warnings to get out of the waters around Subi, but apparently did not interfere with the operation. Since U.S. media has been reporting that the Obama administration was considering conducting a FON operation for the past six months, China was well prepared for this eventuality, even though Washington did not notify Beijing in advance.

China’s foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang criticized the exercise, saying the U.S. Navy ship “illegally entered” the waters near the islands “without receiving permission from the Chinese government,” “threatened China’s sovereignty and security interests,” and “endangered regional peace and stability.” This language suggests that China in fact does claim a 12-nautical-mile territorial sea around formerly submerged reefs that it has built into artificial islands, which is contrary to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. In addition, the spokesman warned that China would “firmly respond to any deliberate provocation by any country.” Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Yesui summoned U.S. ambassador to China Max Baucus to protest what he claimed was a “serious provocation.”

<strong>Q4: How are other regional states likely to respond?</strong>

<strong>A4: </strong>The majority of countries in the region are likely to welcome the U.S. decision to conduct FON operations around Chinese artificial islands that were previously submerged reefs. The other claimants, non-claimants in maritime Southeast Asia, as well as nations outside the region, such as Japan and Australia, are increasingly concerned about China’s militarization of its islands, its coercive behavior, and the possibility that China might declare an Air Defense Identification Zone in the South China Sea as it did in the East China Sea in November 2013. Australia, Japan, and the Philippines have issued statements supporting the U.S. action. Most other nations will likely opt to refrain from making public statements to avoid provoking China’s ire.

<strong>Q5: What comes next?</strong>

<strong>A5: </strong>U.S. officials have made clear that this will not be the last FON operation in and around the Spratly Islands. There will be follow-up operations around other Chinese features and perhaps around those of other claimant nations in order to further the message that FON operations are regular, non-provocative aspects of U.S. policy not specifically targeted at China, and to challenge other types of excessive claims (the recent operation was tailored specifically at objecting to the ability of an artificial island to generate a territorial sea). These operations will be narrowly defined to achieve legal ends, and will happen with regularity but not so frequently as to be intentionally provocative. For the same reason, it is unlikely that the United States will seek to perform joint FON operations with other regional states, though it continues to urge Australia, Japan, and other regional partners to perform operations of their own to assert their rights in the South China Sea.

Follow-on FON operations might include a transit or patrol around Mischief Reef, which like Subi Reef was submerged at high-tide before China’s reclamation work transformed it. They could include “innocent passage” transits within 12 nautical miles of some of China’s other features in the Spratlys that were above water before their expansion. Innocent passage under international law is the right of civilian and military vessels to peacefully sail through the territorial waters of a foreign country as long as they do not perform activities not directly related to transit (including military exercises and intelligence gathering). Chinese navy ships made an innocent passage through U.S. waters around the Aleutian Islands in early September. And they could, and in fact should, include similar operations around rocks or islands occupied by the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia in the Spratlys, as well as Vietnamese-occupied submerged features, as it has in the past.

		<title>How Will China Respond to Future U.S. Freedom of Navigation Operations?</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On October 27, the USS <em>Lassen</em> carried out the first <a href="http://amti.csis.org/the-u-s-asserts-freedom-of-navigation-in-the-south-china-sea/">freedom of navigation (FON) patrol</a> to challenge China’s territorial claims over the 12-nautical-mile region surrounding its artificial islands in the South China Sea. Chinese authorities responded angrily but cautiously, publicly condemning the act and sending two naval ships to trail the <em>Lassen</em>, but stopping short of actions that might interfere with the operation. U.S. authorities have affirmed that future FON operations will follow, while Chinese <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-10/27/c_134754576.htm">authorities have pledged</a> to "resolutely respond" to "future provocations."

The stakes are high for both sides. The U.S. determination to maintain unimpeded military access to the international waters of the South China Sea reflects their importance as an economic and strategic passageway, and for enabling U.S. intervention in any Asian contingency. China’s determination reflects its view that control of those waters is necessary to secure its vulnerable southern flank, facilitate exploitation of lucrative fishing and mineral resources, and weaken the ability of the United States to intervene militarily in an Asian contingency. Senior leaders on both sides have weighed in directly on the matter. In a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/28/remarks-president-obama-united-nations-general-assembly">speech to the United Nations</a>, President Barack Obama stated that the United States has “an interest in upholding the basic principles of freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce." In an <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/18/us-china-britain-xi-q-a-idUSKCN0SC03920151018">interview published weeks later,</a> President Xi Jinping said, “The Chinese people will not allow anyone to infringe on China's sovereignty and related rights and interests in the South China Sea.” While the first operation passed largely without incident, the stage remains set for future confrontations. How such a situation plays out will depend on numerous factors, one of the most important of which is how China chooses to react.

In assessing China’s potential response to follow-on operations, the extremes of either complete inaction or a military attack can be ruled out. Inaction is implausible because statements by senior Chinese leaders have put the country’s credibility on the line. Nor will simple public statements of criticism be enough. Inaction on the water could be read as a lack of confidence or fear of U.S. power, which could embolden rival disputants to more aggressively challenge Chinese claims. An inadequate response could also weaken Beijing’s efforts to position itself as an alternative security leader for Asia.

However, the downside to military overreaction is even more perilous. Should Chinese forces attack a U.S. naval patrol, it would constitute an act of military aggression. China would certainly insist that its actions constituted self-defense, but the lack of a clear threat posed by a U.S. patrol engaged in an activity most of the world regards as legitimate would have consequences on global opinion. The escalation of tensions between the two countries would prove difficult to control. The two countries would also witness an increased risk of follow-on clashes and possibly even of a destructive regional war.

Between these two implausible extremes lies a range of options that could better serve China’s purposes of demonstrating resolve, raising the cost and risk for U.S. operations, deterring rival claimants, and reinforcing China’s authority as a security leader for Asia. The options are constrained by available military and non-military maritime assets, however.  For military assets seeking to serve in a non-lethal role, a lack of permanently stationed aircraft on the incomplete runways China is building in the South China Sea limits air operations to occasional reconnaissance sorties from Hainan Island. The most promising asset will continue to be the types of vessels that trailed the USS <em>Lassen</em>. China has traditionally <a href="http://www.alternet.org/rss/breaking_news/1031393/china_navy_ship_runs_aground_in_disputed_south_china_sea">posted a few frigates or destroyers</a> in the Spratly Islands to demonstrate presence and provide overwatch for coast guard operations. In addition to shadowing, China could send one of these vessels to harass a U.S. ship on patrol, as it has done in other waters near the mainland. <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/chinese-warship-nearly-collided-with-uss-cowpens-1.257478">In December 2013</a>, for example, a People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) frigate nearly collided with the cruiser USS <em>Cowpens</em> while attempting to ward off the U.S. ship, which was operating in waters near the Chinese aircraft carrier <em>Liaoning</em>. Harassment by a naval ship carries large risks, however. Attempts to ram or otherwise obstruct a U.S. warship could result in a serious crisis. Should the situation escalate into a clash, the untested Chinese forces could well suffer a humiliating loss at the hands of the U.S. Navy – with potentially destabilizing domestic political consequences for Beijing.

Coast guard ships could serve as less risky assets for more aggressive harassment options. Working in coordination with fishing trawlers, these boats could engage in dangerous maneuvers that raise the risk of a collision. China has a history of relying on such assets for this purpose. In recent years, its coast guard ships have <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-25/no-guns-as-china-s-coast-guard-chases-boats-in-south-china-sea">used water cannons and rammed</a> vessels from Vietnam, the Philippines, and other countries. China has used these assets against U.S. vessels as well. In 2009, Chinese fishing <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/pentagon-five-chinese-vessels-harass-u-s-ship-1.89046">trawlers harassed the USNS <em>Impeccable</em></a>, while PLAN and maritime law enforcement ships watched nearby. Beijing could use any resultant crisis involving coast guard vessels or fishing trawlers to emphasize the risks and costs of the operations to U.S. decisionmakers. Unlike the dangerous harassment scenarios involving PLAN ships, a crisis involving Chinese coast guard or trawlers would poses far fewer risks. Their involvement would also reinforce the Chinese efforts to depict a confrontation as one of a law enforcement nature.

China thus has a graduated range of responses available for future U.S. operations.  For the near term, the exact option selected will depend largely on the message Beijing seeks to send regarding the state of bilateral relations. When China seeks to stabilize ties and avoid further deterioration, as is the case today, more restrained options are likely. However, at times when Beijing feels frustrated or senses opportunities to test U.S. resolve, it may find riskier options more appealing. Over the medium to long term, the situation will grow even more complicated for the United States. China will eventually complete the construction of military facilities in the Spratlys, enabling it to station a larger and more diverse array of coast guard vessels, as well as a small number of naval combatants, missiles, and combat aircraft in the area. As China expands its economic investments in Southeast Asia, it will have an added incentive to seek control of the South China Sea. Managing the risks of crisis and conflict will likely grow even more challenging, complex, and important in coming years.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How the U.S. FON Program Is Lawful and Legitimate</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The U.S. Freedom of Navigation (FON) <a href="http://policy.defense.gov/Portals/11/Documents/gsa/cwmd/DoD%20FON%20Program%20--%20Fact%20Sheet%20(March%202015).pdf">Program</a> has recently drawn significant attention in the United States and abroad. An argument could be made that the program has received more attention in 2015 than in its preceding 35 years combined. This recent focus arose as the world <a href="http://amti.csis.org/island-tracker/">witnessed</a> China engage in reclamation (enhancement of naturally-formed areas of land) and “clamation” (construction of artificial islands on low-tide elevations and submerged features) in the Spratly Island group in the South China Sea – activities on an unprecedented scale and with questionable intent.

Senior U.S. <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/606676/iiss-shangri-la-dialogue-a-regional-security-architecture-where-everyone-rises">officials</a>, including <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/25/remarks-president-obama-and-president-xi-peoples-republic-china-joint">President Barack Obama</a>, have publicly declared that the United States “will continue to sail, fly, and operate anywhere that international law allows.” The world now watches as U.S. military vessels and aircraft <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/10/after-months-of-waiting-us-finally-begins-freedom-of-navigation-patrols-near-chinas-man-made-islands/">conduct</a> FON operations (FONOPs) in the South China Sea, including in the waters and airspace around the features in question. Much has been said and written recently about U.S. FONOPs – some of which is incomplete, inaccurate, or both. Below is an attempt to set the record straight on the matter, based upon this author’s prior experience with the U.S. FON Program at the operational, theater-strategic, and policy levels of the U.S. military.

The U.S. FON policy was not newly established by the Obama administration. In fact, the United States has made it a priority to preserve the freedom of the seas throughout the nation’s history. Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan formally established and developed the FON Program nearly four decades ago, but a number of their predecessors also <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=16012">emphasized</a> the U.S. interest in preserving the freedom of the seas and highlighted the role of U.S. naval and air forces in preserving that national interest around the world. The program involves activities undertaken by multiple departments of the U.S. government – in other words, it is <em>not</em> purely a Department of Defense (DoD) effort nor limited solely to FONOPs.

The FON Program is firmly rooted in the rules of international law. Since the program’s inception, a fundamental guiding <a href="http://www.jag.navy.mil/organization/documents/Reagan%20Ocean%20Policy%20Statement.pdf">principle</a> has been to “not acquiesce in unilateral acts of other states designed to restrict” the freedom of the seas. As was recently clarified in the DoD maritime security <a href="http://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/NDAA%20A-P_Maritime_SecuritY_Strategy-08142015-1300-FINALFORMAT.PDF">strategy</a>, freedom of the seas means “<em>all</em> [emphasis added] of the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea and airspace, including for military ships and aircraft, recognized under international law.” Reaffirming the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), this freedom of the seas includes, among other things, the rights of innocent passage (Art. 17), transit passage (Art. 38), archipelagic sea lanes passage (Art. 53), the freedoms of navigation and overflight and “other internationally lawful uses of the sea” (Art. 58), and the freedom of the high seas (Art. 87). Thus, despite efforts by some to narrowly construe what international law guarantees to states in the oceans and airspace of the world, the phrase “freedom of the seas” legitimately includes far more than the freedom for commercial vessels.

The U.S. FON Program is guided, managed, planned, and executed in a manner that is fully consistent with international law. Before the United States decides whether to respond diplomatically or operationally to a maritime claim asserted by a coastal state, the appropriate lawyers, policy advisers, and technical experts within the U.S. government conduct coordinated analysis of that foreign maritime claim in relation to the applicable international law, and assess whether that claim is consistent with that body of law. Following international jurisprudence, the U.S. legal analysis draws primarily from the text of UNCLOS, the extensive negotiating history of that treaty, other rules of customary international law, and relevant state practice. To the extent practicable, the United States is transparent about those assessments through official publications such as the Department of State’s <a href="http://www.state.gov/e/oes/ocns/opa/c16065.htm"><em>Limits in the Seas </em>studies</a> and <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/l/c8183.htm"><em>Digest of United States Practice in International Law</em></a>, and the Department of Defense’s <a href="http://www.jag.navy.mil/organization/code_10_mcrm.htm"><em>Maritime Claims Reference Manual</em></a>. Moreover, for any action that the U.S. government does decide to take against an excessive maritime claim, the appropriate lawyers, policy advisers, and technical experts within the government are also involved in drafting, planning, and carrying out those actions. In short, these official U.S. actions are deliberate and lawful.

With regard to the range of those U.S. actions, the FON Program can be <a href="http://www.state.gov/e/oes/ocns/opa/maritimesecurity/">broken down</a> into two lines of effort: diplomatic and operational activities. Yet merely because there are two distinct lines of effort within the program should not be misconstrued as those efforts being conducted at cross purposes. To the contrary, these activities are effectively synchronized. Having worked closely with legal and policy colleagues at the U.S. Department of State on these matters, this author can personally attest that the two departments are almost always aligned on whether they consider a particular foreign maritime claim to be excessive under international law, and on ensuring that the U.S. government takes appropriate actions to preserve the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea covered by that foreign claim. It is the exception, not the norm, when the two departments have differences of opinion on these matters.

In the diplomatic line of effort of the program, the U.S. government engages coastal states around the world when those countries are developing or establishing maritime claims along their respective coastlines. When appropriate, legal and oceanographic experts from the U.S. government will provide constructive feedback to those coastal states on specific ways to help ensure that their prospective maritime claims are fully consistent with international law. When a coastal state asserts a maritime claim that is ambiguous, the Department of State will exchange diplomatic communications with that country and request clarification on the nature of the claim and the legal justification for it. These diplomatic communications can take the form of either a written demarché or an across-the-table conversation between the appropriate representatives of the two governments, or a combination of the two. If a coastal state enacts a maritime claim that is excessive (i.e., inconsistent with international law), then the U.S. Department of State will issue an official diplomatic protest to that country’s government in order to register a formal objection to the excessive claim. When discussing FONOPs, it is useful to be aware of this diplomatic line of effort to appreciate how the United States goes to great efforts to encourage other states to clarify their maritime claims and communicate U.S. objections to excessive ones. Often times, U.S. FONOPs are conducted only after the coastal state has repeatedly declined to clarify its questionable claim or reform its excessive nature.

In the operational line of effort of the FON Program, DoD and U.S. Coast Guard forces conduct FONOPs and what are described as “other FON-related activities.” The difference between the two is that FONOPs have the primary purpose of challenging an excessive maritime claim, while the second category has some other primary goal, such as information collection, with challenging an excessive claim being a secondary effect.

Some may wonder why the United States does not limit its challenges of excessive maritime claims to solely the diplomatic arena. The formation and development of international law, especially in the context of customary law, is about state practice. Such practice is demonstrated by both the official words <em>and</em> official actions of individual states, with each reinforcing the other. If a coastal state establishes an excessive claim and others protest it through diplomatic means only, what happens if the coastal state simply ignores those diplomatic protests or declines to reform its excessive claim? Acquiescence by others poses a risk of legitimizing the coastal state’s excessive claim – if not as a matter of law, then at least in effect. The net result could be that the coastal state has de facto changed international law to achieve its strategic ends. Thus the FON Program’s operational activities reinforce U.S. public statements and diplomatic communications, and are fully consistent with the official protest of an excessive claim. In that way, the United States is simply standing up for its freedom, and that of other states, as guaranteed in international law.

For these reasons, the U.S. FON Program, FON policy, and FONOPs are lawful and legitimate.

		<title>Can Japan Join U.S. Freedom of Navigation Operations in the South China Sea?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The United States has started long overdue freedom of navigation (FON) operations in the South China Sea. Washington launched the FON program in 1979 to challenge coastal states’ excessive maritime claims through diplomatic engagement and operational assertion. During the Cold War the United States conducted FON operations in Soviet territorial seas, where Moscow did not permit innocent passage by foreign warships. It took 10 years for Washington and Moscow to reach a common understanding of innocent passage in 1989 after several incidents between their naval forces. Likewise Washington will continue the FON program in the South China Sea with strong determination for years to come until it can reach a common understanding of freedom of navigation with Beijing.

U.S. FON operations in the South China Sea provide both opportunities and challenges for the U.S.-Japan alliance. After the October 26 patrol of the USS Lassen within 12 nautical miles of Subi Reef, occupied by China, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe immediately said he understood the operation was conducted under international law. During a meeting with Chinese premier Li Keqiang in Seoul, Abe directly delivered his concern about China’s artificial island-building. A U.S.-Japan combined naval drill in the South China Sea was also announced. Tokyo will support U.S. diplomatic and military efforts to preserve freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.

The recent U.S. FON operation in the South China Sea will allow the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) to increase its presence in the international waterway. Pending Japan’s new security legislation taking effect next spring, the JMSDF can still show its flag with the U.S. Navy in the South China Sea by joining U.S. intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance activities and drills, although the JMSDF is not allowed to defend U.S. naval forces in an armed contingency.

Once the new security legislation becomes effective, JMSDF will be allowed to defend U.S. forces under the new U.S.-Japan Defense Guidelines, making combined operations more effective. The JMSDF will even be able to provide logistical support for the United States and its allied and coalition forces in a contingency, if the situation is designated as having important influence on Japan’s security. This will require careful planning and training, and perhaps the procurement of additional capabilities such as patrol aircraft.

Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the JMSDF will join U.S. FON operations inside 12 nautical miles of Chinese-occupied reefs until the Japanese government is sure about their legal status. Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida testified in the Japanese parliament, the Diet, that the government has no clue how to determine the legal status of Chinese-occupied reefs in the disputed Spratly Islands. In other words, the Japanese government cannot tell whether those reefs are legally rocks, which states can claim as part of their territory, or low-tide elevations, which for the most part they cannot.

That said, a final decision by an international tribunal, which has just ruled that it can take on a case between China and the Philippines over Beijing’s South China Sea claims, might open the way for U.S.-Japan joint FON operation within 12 nautical miles. If the arbitration clarifies the legal status of Chinese-occupied reefs and finds some are merely low-tide elevations, then Tokyo can determine their status. The decision from the court is expected as early as June 2016. In the meantime, Tokyo should prepare for potential joint FON assertions while reinforcing diplomatic efforts to reach a common understanding with China.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Implications of the Philippines v. China Award on Jurisdiction</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Philippines scored a procedural victory on October 29, successfully dodging the jurisdiction and admissibility objections posed by China's <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-12/07/content_19037946.htm">position paper</a> released last December regarding Manila’s case against Beijing’s South China Sea claims. In a 151-page <a href="http://www.pcacases.com/web/sendAttach/1506">decision</a>, a tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague affirmed the primacy of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in determining the parties' maritime rights and assured the integrity and efficacy of the compulsory dispute settlement procedures permitted by <a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338703-unclos-e.html">Part XV of UNCLOS</a>.

The tribunal’s decision firmly rejected one country’s non-appearance and refusal to participate (a vexing tactic similarly employed by Russia in the ongoing <em>Arctic Sunrise</em> case) as a bar to the UNCLOS Annex VII compulsory arbitration procedure and reinforced it against the challenge of <em>realpolitik</em>. It disposed of China's complaint that the Philippines' unilateral initiation of arbitration proceedings is an "abuse of legal process" in the absence of Chinese consent and participation, essentially freeing states from being obligated to endlessly negotiate disputes in deadlock.

The tribunal declared that the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation and the 2002 Declaration of Conduct for Parties in the South China Sea do not prevent any claimants from seeking third party dispute settlement. This rebuffed China's insistence that settlement of the South China Sea disputes has been "locked in" by broad regional consensus. The decision also declared that the participation of other South China Sea claimants is not necessary, especially since Vietnam concurred with the tribunal's jurisdiction, and none of the other interested parties (Malaysia, Brunei, and even Indonesia) objected despite notice and confidential access to the proceedings.

Most important, the tribunal accepted the Philippine formulation that the 15 claims submitted for judgement only concern the interpretation and application of UNCLOS, not the sovereignty disputes over the various maritime features dotting the South China Sea, and are therefore subject to arbitration. The question of which maritime zones specific features are entitled to has been successfully detached from the issue of delimitation between overlapping maritime zones (from which China has exempted itself), and the tribunal has accepted jurisdiction to decide the former separately. Four of the seven Philippine claims that the tribunal declared fall within its jurisdiction are of this nature.

The remaining three claims over which the tribunal found jurisdiction concern the legality of Chinese activities that endanger Philippine vessels, as well as destructive fishing practices in Scarborough and Second Thomas shoals. These claims involve maritime rights and obligations concerning safety of navigation, life at sea, and obligations to conserve and protect the marine environment that apply to all states regardless of which (and whose) maritime zone the actions take place in.

On seven other Philippine claims, the tribunal found that the question of jurisdiction requires consideration of the merits of the case, and thus deferred judgment on jurisdiction until after further hearings. As for a final general request for an order for China to "desist from further unlawful claims and activities," the tribunal has requested that the Philippines clarify what those further claims and activities are.

Ultimately this means that all the Philippine claims will have their day in court. It does not suggest that China stands to lose the case completely. Beijing’s secondary line of defense – that each measure for relief requested by Manila ultimately requires maritime delimitation to be carried out before it can be granted – remains to be considered with the merits of the case. Numerous caveats emphasize that jurisdiction is still subject to the effects of any possible overlapping maritime entitlements.

But the jurisdictional decision already stands to benefit other states, regardless of the case’s final outcome. China's “nine-dash line” claim to most of the South China Sea may now be legally discussed, explained, and evaluated by the tribunal based on the cumulative uncoordinated statements and explanations of Chinese officials and academics, but without their direct participation. Internationally, this could seriously undermine China's influence over South China Sea stakeholders; domestically, it could challenge the credibility of its leadership.

Other states with their own maritime disputes with China now have a proven legal approach that could be used to bring specific incidents before other Annex VII tribunals, especially those concerning Chinese operations to assert maritime claims beyond the potential 12-nautical-mile territorial sea of any land feature. In particular, incidents involving maritime rights and obligations owed to all states regardless of location at sea could be ripe for referral to Part XV compulsory procedures. Although the substance of any prospective claims could be different so as to avoid potential weaknesses in the Philippine case, a procedural roadmap now exists to bring a dispute to arbitration.

The tribunal's decision indicates that China's recent reliance on exceptionalism and realpolitik by harsh assertiveness and disproportionate unilateralism, begun with non-appearance in the arbitration proceedings and culminating in the shocking mass-destruction and conversion of vast coral reefs into artificial islands for potential military control of the disputed area, appears to have backfired. No doubt the tribunal was somewhat conscious of the need to ensure the relevance of UNCLOS dispute settlement mechanisms to the most complex of all maritime and territorial disputes. Any further use of raw power and military/paramilitary strategy would solidify the emergent alignment between other claimants and external parties rallying behind the mutually accepted legal order established by UNCLOS. Worse for China, it could soon invite further, and potentially coordinated, legal challenges from other states.]]></content:encoded>

The period from 2006 to 2008, when China reached out to Southeast Asian neighbors and cooperated with the United States on a number of important issues, was one of the most constructive in the modern history of Chinese foreign policy.

But in recent years, many countries in the region have come to see China as more assertive following incidents like its occupation of Scarborough Shoal in 2012 and its vast reclamation projects on seven features in the Spratly Islands. The China-Vietnam relationship hit a record low in May 2014 following the deployment of a Chinese oil drilling platform in Vietnam’s claimed exclusive economic zone, and has yet to return its previous level. Ahead of Xi’s visit, an open letter began circulating online on October 15 signed by more than two hundred vocal Vietnamese bloggers and activists, including intellectuals and former high-ranking bureaucrats, denouncing China’s aggressive behavior in the South China Sea and asking the Vietnamese government to take a tough stance in settling territorial disputes.

Despite speculation, the South China Sea dispute was not the focus of Xi’s visit. The dispute was dealt with very parsimoniously during his talks with Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, President Truong Tan Sang, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, and National Assembly Chairman Nguyen Sinh Hung, as well as in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4_OL8-dRjI">his speech to a session of the National Assembly</a>.

President Xi and Prime Minister Dung <a href="http://baochinhphu.vn/Tin-noi-bat/Thu-tuong-hoi-kien-Tong-Bi-thu-Chu-tich-Trung-Quoc-Tap-Can-Binh/240742.vgp">agreed to manage tensions</a> through consultation, and to maintain maritime stability based on a 2011 bilateral Agreement on Basic Principles Guiding the Settlement of Sea-Related Issues. General Secretary Trong <a href="http://dangcongsan.vn/cpv/Modules/News/NewsDetail.aspx?co_id=10010&amp;cn_id=741984">stressed</a> to Xi the importance of maintaining the status quo, refraining from expanding the scope of the dispute, and avoiding militarization of islands. The Chinese president, through a sugarcoated speech and promises about renewed aid, offered Vietnam more carrots than sticks.

Xi’s visit had a straightforward purpose: he wanted to reassure Vietnamese leaders that China’s intentions in the South China Sea are benign. Why did he choose to show such restraint during the visit to Hanoi?

The United States, after struggling domestically to reach consensus on how best to respond to China’s assertive behavior, appears to have adopted a tougher policy. The recent transit of a U.S. Navy destroyer within 12 nautical miles of a Chinese artificial islands in the Spratlys received plaudits from Australia, Japan, and the Philippines, and implicit endorsements from other countries like Vietnam. China is responding by making overtures toward regional countries inclined to lean toward the United States, including Vietnam. At the same time, China is hinting that great power rivalry between China and the United States could inflict heavy damage on smaller states.

Amid this tense situation, China's latest charm offensive in Vietnam has been mired in controversy over economic sovereignty and political priorities. The complexity of the Vietnam-China relationship has multiplied given the widening power gap between the two countries. Like other Southeast Asian nations, Vietnam is witnessing the global power shift in favor of China but Vietnamese leaders assume that they know how to manage their relationship with great powers to serve their national interests. Some might have an overly sanguine belief that Xi's visit indicates China has shifted to an inclusive and cooperative approach to resolve the disputes in the South China Sea. But Vietnamese history buffs will find it hard to trust any such Chinese offers. So yes, Xi's visit was a big deal, and perhaps even historic, but it was also more symbolic than substantive.

The decision to host a high-profile visit by President Xi at all was a risk by the Vietnamese leadership. With only three months until the Vietnamese Communist Party's next congress, open advocacy of a more accommodating policy toward China could prove politically dangerous amid the fierce contest for key positions in Vietnam's political system. The price could prove costly if Xi's visit leads to further outbursts of anti-China nationalism or causes speculation that Beijing is trying to impact Vietnam's leadership transition.

Consequently, the leadership in Hanoi was pragmatic. Immediately after Xi's visit, Vietnamese officials hosted Japan's defense minister Gen Nakatani for a two-day visit that focused heavily on maritime security in the South China Sea. During the trip, Nakatani announced that Vietnam had invited Japan to take part in humanitarian exercises and to have a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/06/us-vietnam-china-idUSKCN0SV0FY20151106#YlLAfDDXZ7wEgWDm.97">Maritime Self Defense Forces ship visit</a> the strategic naval base at Cam Ranh Bay. Earlier this year, Japan delivered the first of six patrol vessels promised to the Vietnam Marine Police. The remaining ships will be delivered later this year and will be valuable additions to Hanoi's inadequate maritime security capabilities.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ahead of this month’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and ASEAN summits, regional maritime tensions have taken a dangerous turn, potentially setting off a new round of confrontation between relevant powers. A month after the <a href="http://amti.csis.org/asia-all-eyes-on-the-obama-xi-summit/">meeting</a> of Presidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping in Washington, during which the two leaders signed off on <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-us-china-summits-big-accomplishment-rules-the-sky-13960">new confidence-building measures</a> and reached <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2985089/us-china-appear-close-on-cyber-economic-espionage-deal.html">an agreement</a> on cybersecurity, the United States pushed ahead with a much-anticipated <a href="http://amti.csis.org/fonops-primer/">freedom of navigation</a> (FON) operation within 12 nautical miles of a Chinese-occupied feature in the South China Sea. Beijing responded <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/28/china-not-frightened-fight-war-south-china-sea-uss-lassen">with a flurry</a> of diplomatic condemnations, with top naval commander Adm. Wu Shengli <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2015/10/30/China-warns-of-stronger-military-response-after-US-provocation/9421446217328/">warning</a> that China will “have to take all necessary measures to safeguard [its] sovereignty and security" in the South China Sea.

A few days after the FON operation, a tribunal at Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague announced that it will <a href="http://amti.csis.org/implications-of-the-philippines-v-china-award-on-jurisdiction/">exercise jurisdiction</a> in the Philippines’ arbitration case against China. Beijing’s response was furious, with the government mouthpiece Xinhua news agency <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-n-court-rules-it-can-arbitrate-south-china-sea-dispute-1446175002">warning</a> that Philippine-China relations have been “sinking to a historic low.”

When they meet at the APEC and ASEAN summits, leaders from the Philippines, China, and the United States will have to pull off a delicate balancing act between standing their ground (or appearing to do so) on the South China Sea, on one hand, and exploring creative ways to avoid unwanted escalation, arrive at a sustainable mechanism to effectively manage (if not resolve) the disputes, and focus on common areas of interest, on the other.

<strong>Prospects for Dialogue </strong>

<strong> </strong>Fortunately, despite rising tensions in the wake of last month’s FON operation, both Washington and Beijing have <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/us-china-navies-agree-to-maintain-dialogue-to-avoid-clashes">maintained robust</a> communications channels to avoid accidental clashes, with President Obama seeking <a href="http://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/International-Relations/Obama-seeks-meeting-with-Xi-on-South-China-Sea">a direct meeting</a> with his Chinese counterpart to specifically discuss the management of South China Sea disputes. So one can expect constant coordination between the two powers in the course of future U.S. operations in the contested area.

Meanwhile, China has been confronting a legal coup from the Philippines. The tribunal’s decision to move forward with the Philippines’ case against China has further complicated bilateral relations, which are arguably the <a href="http://www.policyforum.net/a-toxic-relationship/">most toxic</a> in Asia. During his short (and first) trip to Manila to prepare the ground for Xi’s APEC visit, Foreign Minister Wang Yi <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/11/11/uk-southchinasea-china-philippines-idUKKCN0T007E20151111">criticized</a> the Philippines’ arbitration case as “a knot that has impeded the improvement and development of Sino-Philippine relations." And it is not yet clear whether President Benigno Aquino will hold his first ever bilateral summit with Xi on the sidelines of the APEC leaders meeting.

Now that the jurisdiction hurdle has been (partially) overcome, the Philippines has paved the way for a “legal multiplier,” exposing China to similar suits by other claimant states such as Vietnam, which has been <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/vietnam-considering-legal-action-against-china-reu/1920048.html">openly threatening</a> to do so since last year. Even Indonesia <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/11/11/uk-southchinasea-china-philippines-idUKKCN0T007E20151111">is mulling</a> a similar legal maneuver against China. And the Philippines’ plan to sign a <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/10/vietnam-philippines-near-new-strategic-partnership/">strategic partnership</a> (with a focus on maritime security cooperation) with Vietnam, another claimant state stuck in a bitter dispute with China, is surely going to irk China. The planned agreement, which could be inked on the sidelines of APEC, is designed to signal the determination of the two Southeast Asian countries to fortify their emerging alliance amid China’s unbridled assertiveness in the South China Sea. The Philippine Supreme Court could also rule on the constitutionality of the 10-year U.S.-Philippine Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement <a href="http://m.philstar.com/314191/show/d53a59c69a3f5ef9cc5630ab70d3d65e">two days before</a> Obama lands in Manila for APEC, potentially giving Aquino and him something to celebrate, to China’s displeasure. If the Supreme Court strikes down the agreement and demands Senate ratification, the two allies will have to urgently explore alternative mechanisms for enhancing their maritime security cooperation.

<strong>A Bumpy Ride</strong>

The coming weeks are poised to be a bumpy ride for Philippine-China relations, especially as their respective leaders try to project toughness before their domestic audiences amid the intensifying disputes in the South China Sea. In multilateral fora, China has taken <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/08/after-south-china-sea-finger-pointing-at-asean-meeting-china-offers-its-defense/">a hardline</a> position that the disputes should not be mentioned. In an echo of the 2012 debacle at the ASEAN <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-18825148">foreign ministers meeting</a> in Cambodia, China last month managed to sabotage efforts to address the South China Sea during the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting Plus, leading to <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/asia-u-s-defense-ministers-fail-to-reach-south-china-sea-agreement-1446605460">a failure</a> to even issue a joint statement.

The majority of countries in the region, including non-claimant states like Singapore and Indonesia, are concerned about FON in the area, and have <a href="http://amti.csis.org/showdown-at-shangri-la-confronting-chinas-maritime-ambitions/">expressed worries</a> over China’s unilateral overhaul of the regional seascape. But China’s diplomatic intransigence is undermining existing regional platforms for dialogue under the aegis of ASEAN.

The forthcoming summits could still provide a crucial breathing space – an opportune platform for much-needed engagement among concerned parties, including the United States, which has become <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/us-directly-drawn-into-south-china-sea-disputes">more involved</a> in the South China Sea disputes than ever. As the host of the APEC summit, and with a bilateral meeting between Xi and Aquino expected, Manila has a rare opportunity to, at the very least, establish much-needed confidence building measures with Beijing in order to manage their increasingly contentious maritime disputes. Proactive diplomacy has become more urgent than ever.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This September, while Indian prime minister Narendra Modi met with tech titans in Silicon Valley, his administration <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/modi-governments-rs-10000-crore-plan-to-transform-andaman-and-nicobar-islands/articleshow/49111067.cms">quietly unveiled</a> a $1.5 billion development package for the isolated Andaman and Nicobar island chains, meant to turn the islands’ capital city, Port Blair, into a hub of the ship repair industry by developing port infrastructure. Less than two weeks later, the government <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/indian-islands-to-be-developed-under-swiss-challenge-model-115100500050_1.html">announced</a> that it would soon begin to create an economic development plan for its island territories. The two announcements followed years of <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-to-strengthen-andaman-and-nicobar-command-to-take-on-china-542397">claims</a> that India is quietly taking steps to strengthen its military posture in the islands. Put together, they seem to show that India is finally taking its eastern outposts seriously.

Any sign of increased investment in the Andaman and Nicobar islands will please those who want India to play a larger and more aggressive role in policing the Indian Ocean. The announcement, however, should be understood in the context of Indian domestic politics and India’s long history of poor follow-through when it comes to its domestic security. It remains to be seen whether India will sustain its renewed attention on its own “Far East.”

Arcing north-northwest from the northern tip of Sumatra, the Andaman and Nicobar islands are far closerW to Myanmar and Indonesia than to mainland India and are only 200 nautical miles from Singapore. Many of the islands are home only to indigenous groups that have strictly limited contact with the outside world, while others are <a href="http://www.abplive.in/author/nitingokhale/2015/05/24/article597458.ece/Strengthening-the-Andaman-Nicobar-Command">uninhabited</a>, making the area vulnerable to foreign infiltration. Their significance lies mainly in their location: near the western outlet of the Malacca Strait and well-situated to form part of what Chinese military strategists have <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Andamans+metal+chain&amp;oq=Andamans+metal+chain&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.4007j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8">called</a> a “metal chain” blocking Chinese access to Europe and the Middle East.

The announcement of the Andaman and Nicobar development package followed nearly a year of increased engagement by New Delhi with the Indian Ocean region, beginning with Modi’s <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/look-east-policy-now-turned-into-act-east-policy-modi/article6595186.ece">visit</a> to Southeast Asia in November. His visits, and the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/look-east-has-become-act-east-policy-pm-modi-at-asean/">announcement</a> that his administration would “Act East” (as opposed to the government’s 20-year-old “Look East” policy), were meant to signal that India has finally gotten serious about exploiting the strategic potential of the Indian Ocean region. The development package for Andaman and Nicobar appears to show that the government is re-envisioning the island chain as an important commercial hub on the route between India and Southeast Asia, as well as strategic outposts.

But the timing and details of the announcement suggest that it has as much to do with India’s electoral politics as with naval strategy. Andaman and Nicobar’s parliamentary representative, a member of Modi’s own Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), <a href="http://www.andamanchronicle.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7397:govt-sanctions-funds-for-development-of-a-n-islands&amp;catid=37:top-news&amp;Itemid=142">leaked</a> the news of the development package to a local newspaper on September 18, four days before the islands held municipal elections. The BJP was facing an unexpectedly strong challenge from the rival Telugu Desam Party (TDP), which went on to win its first-ever seats on Port Blair’s municipal council.

Announcing new funding initiatives in advance of elections is a common campaign strategy in India—as seen in Modi’s <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-announces-rs-1-25-lakh-crore-special-package-for-bihar-1208581">announcement</a> of a $19 billion development package for the northern state of Bihar in the run-up to its hotly contested elections. It is equally common for much of the funds promised during the campaign to disappear after the election takes place.

A closer look at those projects that have already been green-lit makes clear that development will be less seaward-looking than one might expect given Andaman and Nicobar’s status as an archipelago territory. Fully three-quarters of the funds (about $244 million dollars) have been earmarked for road- and bridge-building, with $146 million dollars of that going to build 60 miles of highway. Only $31 million dollars have been designated for a directly maritime-related project (development of a shipping transport facility), with the remaining funds going toward upgrading the Port Blair airport.

Should Modi’s administration fail to follow through on its promises to pay more attention to its maritime territories, it would be following a well-established pattern. India has been promising to beef up its presence in the islands since at least 2001, when it created the Andaman and Nicobar Command. The decision to rotate control of the command among the services, however, <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-to-slowly-but-steadily-boost-military-presence-in-Andaman-and-Nicobar-Islands/articleshow/47182151.cms">prevented</a> development of the islands as a naval hub. In 2008-09, government officials responded positively to a push by Vice Admiral Vijay Shankar, then Commander in Chief of the Andaman and Nicobar Command (CINCAN), to see the islands as “springboards” not “outposts,” but once again little was actually done. More recently, rumors have circulated that the islands might receive a dedicated fleet, but it is unclear whether this reflects government thinking or the <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Andaman-and-Nicobar-Command-should-get-a-fleet-CINCAN/articleshow/43168702.cms">lobbying efforts</a> of the current CINCAN, Vice Admiral PK Chatterjee. In light of this history, observers would do well to heed Chatterjee’s <a href="http://news.niticentral.com/2015/10/09/andaman-nicobar-command-fully-equipped-to-ensure-security-of-isles-cincan/">admission</a> that “future accretions remain a major challenge.”

There is one good reason, however, to believe that India is serious this time: the rise of China and Chinese interest in the Indian Ocean. That interest is most concrete, and most obvious, in the nearby Coco Islands, only 12 miles off the northern tip of the Andamans (and technically a member of the same archipelago). The islands are part of Myanmar, but China has been operating there since 2009, at first <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-india-takes-up-with-myanmar-reports-of-china-base-in-coco-islands-1289045">clandestinely</a> and then more <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Runway-other-infrastructure-being-developed-at-Coco-Islands/articleshow/30063312.cms">openly</a>. The tiny islands are now home to an <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Chinese-naval-ships-detected-near-Andamans/articleshow/48817805.cms">8,000-foot runway</a>, with room for further expansion. India’s concerns about Chinese activity in the eastern Indian Ocean are exacerbated by its <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Andaman-and-Nicobar-Command-should-get-a-fleet-CINCAN/articleshow/43168702.cms">belief</a> that China will eventually build a canal across the <a href="http://asia.nikkei.com/magazine/20150625-IS-ASIA-READY/Politics-Economy/Kra-Isthmus-shortcut-would-mean-big-shifts-in-Southeast-Asia">Isthmus of Kra</a> in Thailand, giving Chinese vessels a relatively direct route into the Indian Ocean.

At least some elements of the Indian security establishment see the Andamans as a weak spot in India’s defenses. An anonymous “senior officer” based in Delhi recently <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Chinese-naval-ships-detected-near-Andamans/articleshow/48817805.cms">told</a> the <em>Times of India </em>that the islands are “[t]he only place where the Chinese can strike without facing any real opposition, merely to bother India” because Indian forces on the mainland are not able to go on alert whenever a Chinese naval vessel is sighted near the islands. With this in mind, a well-placed retired naval officer expressed strong confidence that the government is in fact committed to the naval development of the islands.

While many details of the Indian Navy presence on the islands remain classified, the military appears to have been moving faster than the civilian government. Government officials <a href="http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-09-26/news/66907727_1_jarawa-nicobar-islands-andaman-trunk-road">informed</a> the press that the navy has three critical projects underway in the islands; these may include <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/from-remote-outpost-india-looks-to-check-chinas-indian-ocean-thrust/articleshow/48079380.cms">extending</a> a runway near the southern end of the island chain to 6,000 feet from 3,500, with plans to eventually expand to 10,000 feet. The navy is also <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21617000-india-eyes-strategic-opportunity-bay-bengal-outpost-springboard">reportedly moving</a> “five guided-missile destroyers, three stealth frigates and a nuclear submarine” to the Eastern Command (although not necessarily to the Andamans). Yet while the work has had at least one concrete, obvious effect (installing lights at the Port Blair airport to allow for the <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/building-defence/spicejet-flight-makes-successful-night-landing-at-vsi-airport/articleshow/48935425.cms">first-ever</a> night landings), the navy is still talking more about its <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-to-slowly-but-steadily-boost-military-presence-in-Andaman-and-Nicobar-Islands/articleshow/47182151.cms">plans</a> than its achievements. The Andaman and Nicobar islands’ place in India’s strategic posture remains in limbo.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[More than 190 nations have converged in Paris for the United Nations conference on climate change, or the 21<sup>st</sup> Conference of Parties (COP21). Their goal is to arrest global warming below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) through a legally binding and universal agreement. Scientists posit that temperature is a critical component of the climate change equation because as global temperatures increase, glacial run-off and the thermal expansion of the globe’s watery surfaces will result in 3 feet of sea-level rise by the end of the century.

Experts such as <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/law/people/academic/Professor-David-Caron-.aspx">David Caron</a> and <a href="http://ancors.uow.edu.au/staff/UOW076788.html">Clive Schofield</a> have assessed the dire implications of rising seas on maritime boundaries. This will be especially problematic in the South China Sea because of its unique seasonal weather patterns, currents, and numerous low-lying features.

All of the South China Sea claimants are on hand in Paris for the deliberations, and even if they disagree about their maritime boundaries, they all acknowledge the reality of climate change-induced sea level rise and should be aware of its effects in the South China Sea. For instance, even if China proceeds with fortifying the features on which it has sought to strengthen its claims via land reclamation (or <a href="http://amti.csis.org/terriclaims-the-new-geopolitical-reality-in-the-south-china-sea/">terriclaiming</a>), these projects will not be immune from the corrosive environment of the South China Sea due to predicted sea level rise. The same is true for the other claimants’ outposts in the South China Sea, as well as the danger to their coastlines. With such a commonly held threat, perhaps climate change cooperation on sea level rise could serve as a confidence building measure (CBM) between the parties?

<strong>Adaptation Strategies as a CBM</strong>

Cooperatively developing adaptation strategies for climate change, specifically sea level rise, would be an excellent cooperative CBM approach for the South China Sea claimants. Even though adaptation can be incredibly complex phenomena because of the diversity of interpretations and executions of different nations, adaptation strategies remain predominantly non-proprietary and low-tech. They can range from flood-resistant farming techniques to seawall construction to shared legal frameworks.

Each country has taken on various adaptions plans in anticipation of sea level rise. But differences exist and one size does not necessarily fit all. This is why working cooperatively, while simultaneously building trust and confidence would benefit the claimants. For example, seawall construction may be too expensive or technical for some South China Sea nations to undertake independently, but may be completely within the capacity of others, like Singapore, in cooperation with partners or under the auspices of a larger grouping like ASEAN. A brief comparison between Singapore and Vietnam highlights this prospect.

<a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=289830&amp;fileId=S1355770X04001706">Singapore</a>’s minister for the environment and water resources, Vivian Balakrishnan, has publicly supported sea level rise adaptation initiatives to protect the vulnerable 227-square-mile island nation. As one of the countries in the region most endangered by sea level rise, Singapore’s government has taken substantive steps including commissioning cost-benefit analyses of seawall protection. The researchers involved concluded that protection with an elaborate seawall network was the lowest-cost strategy for the city-state and that Singapore would capitalize fully on its long-term construction and maintenance costs. Tapping into Singapore’s experience with this kind of physical infrastructure construction would also benefit other claimants’ adaptation initiatives, including protecting Vietnam’s major coastal cities.

Vietnam’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, under the leadership of Pham Khoi Nguyen, concluded in 2009 that average temperature in Vietnam is expected to increase about 4.1 degrees Fahrenheit and sea level is expected to rise by up to 2.5 feet. This will threaten Vietnam’s 897-mile-long coastline which includes the massive Mekong River Basin in the south and the smaller Red River Basin in the north. Both of these areas are already prone to flooding, but increasing temperatures combined with sea level rise would exacerbate this dramatically. Vietnam has already worked with the Netherlands on flood-resistant farming techniques that could be readily disseminated to other claimants, such as Malaysia and the Philippines.

<strong>ASEAN as a Climate Change Leader?</strong>

ASEAN would at first appear to be the best forum for addressing regional cooperation on sea level rise. Four of the South China Sea claimants are members: Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. But despite significant opportunity, ASEAN has had a difficult time building momentum or consensus to challenge sea level rise. The United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emphasized this point when it noted that for ASEAN, “effective governance and institutions for facilitating adaptation planning and implementation across multiple sectors within regions was by far the dominant opportunity and constraint.”

Other regional experiences, such as in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB), do not augur well for future adaptation efforts under ASEAN’s leadership. Despite the fact that adaptation plans at the national level have been formulated in all four Lower Mekong countries—Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam—and years have been devoted to the issue, the United Nations has concluded that “transboundary adaptation planning across the LMB does not exist to date.”

If four ASEAN members are unable to cooperate on climate change adaption strategies in a relatively benign environment such as the LMB, then getting all claimants to coordinate in the highly-contested South China Sea, especially under the aegis of ASEAN, seems unlikely. However, individual ASEAN members working together and with outside states have produced fruitful multilateral endeavors, such as the <a href="http://www.coraltriangleinitiative.org/">Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries, and Food Security</a> which focuses on coastal and marine bio-resources. A similar approach could be worth pursuing in the South China. The opportunity exists, and with all the claimants already represented in Paris, the time is right.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thitu Island, called Pag-asa in Filipino, is the largest of the disputed Spratly Islands occupied by the Philippines. It is also the only one that is home to a civilian population. In addition to a small number of military personnel, over 100 civilians, mostly civil servants and their families, live on Thitu. The island is also the seat of government for Kalayaan—the Philippines' smallest municipality, consisting of Thitu and the other eight features the Philippines occupies in the Spratly Islands. <a href="http://amti.csis.org/interview-with-bito-onon-mayor-of-thitu-island/">Mayor Eugenio Bito-onon</a> represents Kalayaan, splitting his time between Thitu and the provincial capital of Puerto Princesa on Palawan. He has been campaigning around the Philippines and abroad to transform his idyllic but disputed municipality into the “Kalayaan Ecotourism Zone.”</p>

<p>Below are photos provided by Mayor Bito-onon showing life on Thitu and its surroundings.</p>

		<title>Possible Consequences of the Philippines’ South China Sea Arbitration Case</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Philippines’ arbitration case against China has created significant new dynamics in the South China Sea disputes. With the prospect of a ruling from the tribunal in the coming months, it is time to ponder the case’s possible consequences. The tribunal will likely reach a decision on at least the seven submissions by the Philippines on which the judges have already announced jurisdiction. But the claimant states, especially China, are unlikely to dramatically change their major policies and positions as a result.

There is a very strong possibility that Beijing will just ignore the arbitration result, as suggested by ongoing deliberations within Chinese policy circles. The Philippines’ approach took China by surprise. Beijing is by no means prepared to settle the South China Sea disputes through legal means. Chinese foreign policy elites are not convinced that the arbitration is about legal contestations between the Philippines and China at all. Many of them firmly believe that Washington has been heavily involved from the beginning, and that Manila initiated the case to provoke and put political pressure on Beijing. These elites point to the coincidental timing of various decisions by the tribunal and U.S. activities in the Asia Pacific. Chinese maritime lawyers claim that there are numerous weaknesses and loopholes in the tribunal’s October 29 <a href="http://amti.csis.org/implications-of-the-philippines-v-china-award-on-jurisdiction/">Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility</a>.

There is almost no convergence of views between China and the Philippines (or other players) on the arbitration case. As a result, the expected ruling could have a number of significant consequences.

First the South China Sea disputes will become increasingly legalistic. The mainstream international understanding will be that the arbitration result is binding on China. The international and regional discourse concerning the South China Sea will likely highlight the legal aspects of the disputes far more. The international press will constantly mention the tribunal’s ruling whenever there is any conflict or tension in the South China Sea. China will almost certainly be criticized by international media for not respecting the ruling. And Vietnam, depending on the specific outcomes of the Philippines’ case, could be more serious about initiating its own legal process against China.

Second, the South China Sea disputes may become more internationalized. Other claimant states, and even some non-claimant countries in the region, will be disappointed by Beijing’s rejection of the tribunal’s judgment. Feeling that they have exhausted other options in dealing with China on the disputes, these countries may decide to encourage external powers to get more involved in security management in the South China Sea. The current ASEAN-China dual-track approach may face greater strains. For instance, the idea of having a regional code of conduct instead of an ASEAN-China code may gain more traction.

Third, the arbitration will likely stimulate a new round of conflicts and tensions in the South China Sea. Some claimant countries will take actions, such as increasing fishing, exploring for new energy resources, and expanding law enforcement activities, in areas the tribunal deems undisputed to test China’s reactions and resolve. This scenario is especially likely if the tribunal denies China any historical rights in the South China Sea on the basis of the nine-dash line. As soon as China responds in a manner that appears inconsistent with the tribunal’s decision, other claimant countries might quickly launch public relations campaigns to condemn China.

Fourth, strategic rivalry between China and other major players in the South China Sea may increase. The South China Sea is not only a dispute about territorial claims and maritime demarcation between a few claimant states. It is also directly relevant to the security structure and regional architecture in the Asia Pacific. Any conflict or tension in the South China Sea is likely to prompt a U.S. reaction; otherwise the United States’ predominant position, its security commitments, and its regional security role would be significantly damaged. There is no evidence that the United States is prepared to adopt a weaker position or policy in the South China Sea anytime soon. In fact, the arbitration may intensify U.S. involvement in the South China Sea. Other major players, including Japan and Australia, may also increase their presence and activities in the South China Sea, for instance by conducting their own freedom of navigation operations. The strategic realignments and security ties between regional states and external powers, especially the United States and Japan, may evolve to China’s disadvantage.

Fifth, China will likely encounter serious diplomatic challenges in the aftermath of the arbitration. In the past few years, many Southeast Asian countries’ concerns about China’s policies in the South China Sea have grown. If a new round of conflict and tension takes place, regional views will very likely turn further against Beijing. As a result, China’s relations with Southeast Asia may experience new constraints. Some ASEAN countries may harbor reservations toward Chinese diplomatic proposals. Beijing may experience difficulties in implementing the Twenty-First Century Maritime Silk Road initiative. It is also very likely that China may face more diplomatic difficulties at regional multilateral settings in the Asia Pacific at which the South China Sea issue is frequently raised, including the ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN post-ministerial meetings, and East Asia Summit. Many countries will use rhetoric accusing China of not respecting international law in the South China Sea disputes. It will be difficult for China to convince others that the tribunal’s decision was unfair or illegal, and thus that China has the right to ignore it, unless the tribunal makes controversial decisions such as declaring Itu Aba (Taiping Island) legally a rock and not an island.

The arbitration will not help resolve the South China Sea disputes, especially the core issues involving territorial sovereignty and maritime demarcations. In the short run, there is likely to be a period of greater turbulence once the tribunal’s decision is known. The extent of conflicts and tensions may depend on the actual ruling by the judges. There will be challenges for all parties concerned, but China may have to face more difficulties than any other country after the arbitration. The major challenge for China will be how to balance its strategic, security, political, and economic interests in the Asia Pacific and beyond with its territorial and maritime interests in the South China Sea. It would be advisable for China to be better prepared to fight the legal battle in the South China Sea disputes instead of its current attitude of trying to avoid legal contestations altogether.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[During a bilateral meeting at the November 18-19 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders’ summit in Manila, Philippine president Benigno Aquino and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe agreed in principle to negotiate the transfer of defense equipment and technology from the Japan Self-Defense Forces to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). If completed, this accord would be Japan’s first defense agreement with an Asian country. More significantly, it is an indication that both countries are determined to pursue a strategic partnership in the face of China’s growing assertiveness in Asia.

The two countries are exploring a strategic partnership to complement their bilateral alliances with the United States. This partnership is made operational by regular bilateral consultations between their heads of state, exchanges between the Philippine Department of National Defense and the Japanese Ministry of Defense, and naval exercises between the Philippine Navy and Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). In the near future, these will be complemented by the provision of defense equipment by Japan to the Philippines and the access for JSDF ships and planes to Philippine bases, enabling Japan to better patrol the South China Sea.

<strong>An Evolving Strategic Partnership</strong>

<strong> </strong>Both the Philippines and Japan have conducted high-level meetings and consultations to solidify their security cooperation. These consultations enable both countries to discuss common challenges, including the apparent assertiveness of China, and the possibility of sharing strategies in dealing with those issues. The 2012 Statement of Intent on Defense Cooperation and Exchanges between the Department of National Defense and the Ministry of Defense provides the institutional framework for defense exchanges and cooperation from the ministerial and senior officer to working and unit-to-unit levels.  As of 2014, the Philippine Navy and JMSDF have conducted two staff-to-staff talks which have facilitated numerous ship visits, education, and training exchanges, and visits of high-level naval officials from both countries.

The 2012 agreement also provides the institutional framework for bilateral defense cooperation between the AFP and JSDF on a broad range of issues such as maritime security, humanitarian assistance, and disaster response. In May 2015, The Philippines and Japan held a joint naval exercise in the South China Sea. Japan sent two JMSDF destroyers—the JS <em>Harusame </em>and <em>Amigri—</em>which conducted a training exercise with the Philippine Navy frigate BRP <em>Ramon Alcaraz</em> focused on communication strategies to respond to “unplanned encounters at sea.” A few weeks after President Aquino’s June 2015 state visit to Japan, a JMSDF reconnaissance plane landed on the western Philippine island of Palawan to take part in a five-day training exercise with the Philippine Navy. The training activity focused on developing the two countries’ naval fleet skills and interoperability in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations, particularly search and rescue of stricken vessels or downed aircraft in the high seas. In 2012, four JMSDF ships visited the Philippines. Two JMSDF ships made a port call in Manila in 2013, and seven more visited the Philippines in 2014. By October, another seven JMSDF ships had already made port calls in Manila and Subic Bay in 2015.

During President Aquino’s June 2015 state visit to Japan, Japanese government sources revealed that he and Prime Minister Abe agreed to start negotiations on the transfer of military equipment, with P-3C Orion patrol aircraft among the potential export items from Japan. After Aquino and Abe’s November 2015 meeting in Manila, Tokyo announced that it plans to immediately transfer to the Philippine Navy three JMSDF Beechcraft TC-90 King Air patrol planes with basic surface and air surveillance radar, to be followed in the near future by P-3C Orions. Japan hopes that by transferring secondhand JSDF reconnaissance planes to the AFP, it can substantially upgrade the Philippines’ surveillance capabilities in response to China’s growing naval presence in the South China Sea.

During his June 2015 state visit, President Aquino also announced the forthcoming negotiation of a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) that would allow the JSDF access to Philippine military bases, including to refuel its ships and planes and to hold joint exercises with the AFP. Defense Secretary Voltair Gazmin said on June 26 that Philippine-Japan defense cooperation already comes in many forms, including educational and personnel exchanges and joint training between the AFP and JSDF.  But he said that in order to train together more substantively, the two countries must formulate a Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) to allow their defense forces to conduct joint field exercises.

<a href="http://csis.org/files/publication/1502qus_seasia.pdf">Sheldon Simon</a> has noted that “A SOFA with Japan would give the Philippines access to training from Japan’s highly developed maritime forces, repair services for the Philippine Navy and Coast Guard, and maritime reconnaissance data. All these become more important as the Philippines acquires additional Japanese [defense] equipment.” The JSDF’s use of Philippine bases on a limited and rotational basis will also be helpful as Japan actively pursues its policy of “<a href="http://www.mofa.go.jp/files/000025032.pdf">proactive contribution to peace</a>” in Asia. With refueling and basing facilities in the Philippines, units of the JSDF can conduct joint patrols with their U.S. counterparts for longer periods of time and over a larger area of the South China Sea. President Aquino, however, pointed out that Manila and Tokyo need to work out the exact terms of the agreement and that the Philippine Senate would have to concur to such an agreement with Japan as it did in the cases of the VFAs with Australia and the United States.

<strong>Way Forward</strong>

<strong> </strong>Along with the transfer of JSDF equipment to the AFP, a SOFA between the Philippines and Japan will cement the strategic partnership between the two countries. A SOFA will qualitatively transform this security partnership since access to Philippine bases will enable Japanese air and naval assets to patrol the South China Sea and support U.S. forces in times of crisis. The agreement will also give the Philippines the opportunity to train with Japan’s highly developed maritime forces and access its maritime reconnaissance data. If the Philippines and Japan find it in their interests to strengthen their newfound security partnership and ensure its long-term viability, they should start negotiations for a SOFA as soon as possible.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Itu Aba/Taiping Island</strong> is the largest naturally-formed feature in the disputed Spratly Islands and the only one occupied by the Republic of China (Taiwan). Its legal status has become a topic of heated debate as the Philippines has argued before an arbitral tribunal at The Hague that Itu Aba cannot sustain human habitation or independent economic life and is therefore legally a rock, not an island as defined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This would entitle Itu Aba to only a 12-nautical-mile territorial sea, not an exclusive economic zone or continental shelf. The government in Taipei insists that Itu Aba has all the necessities for human habitation, including fresh water and local food production, and sought to highlight that during a December 12 visit to the island by Interior Minister Chen Wei-zen. 

Below are photos provided by the government of the Republic of China detailing Chen’s visit to preside over a ceremony marking the completion of renovations to the island’s wharf and lighthouse.

		<title>Malaysia: Recalibrating Its South China Sea Policy?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="Body"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">For a little over a year, between 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, Malaysia’s policy surrounding the South China Sea dispute hit a shroud of confusion. Taken aback by Chinese naval patrols around James Shoal (Beting Serupai in Malay), only 43 nautical miles off the coast of Sarawak State, the government responded with a baffling array of silence, denial, and nonchalance. Malaysian authorities had been caught off balance by China’s audacity, which they had not expected given Kuala Lumpur’s perceived special relationship with Beijing. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Now there is a growing sense of disquiet, if not wariness and exasperation, in Malaysia. There are more questions being asked about Chinese intentions and they are being asked more insistently. While elements of the special win-win relationship between Malaysia and China remain on the political and economic fronts, a very different reality exists in the South China Sea.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Until recently, a Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) vessel had been anchored near South Luconia Shoal (Beting Patinggi Ali), just 84 nautical miles off the coast of Sarawak, since September 4, 2013. Markers placed by the Malaysian government have mysteriously disappeared, replaced by those written in a “foreign language,” according to parliamentary proceedings. The CCG ship has also reportedly chased away Malaysian fishermen from the area and even threatened them, prompting complaints and a call to action by the Sarawak government and the fishermen’s association of Miri, the state’s second largest city. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Given the domestic political significance of Malaysian Borneo—Sarawak and neighboring Sabah State—if this keeps up the federal government will be compelled to rethink its options to respond in these waters. Malaysian naval and maritime enforcement vessels have already stepped up the frequency of patrols in the area, to 345 days in 2015 (as of December 14) from 269 in 2014. The government is also looking to boost the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency’s assets and capacity, including expanding its range of operations to 200 nautical miles from shore. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Shahidan Kassim first raised the matter of the CCG ship’s presence at South Luconia Shoal in Parliament in March 2014. In June 2015, he broke with convention by taking to Facebook to highlight the “intrusion.” His post, complete with aerial photos, marked a departure from the Malaysian government’s usually muted approach to the South China Sea disputes. Shahidan’s actions may have been anomalous given the quiet diplomacy that still prevails among the political and military leadership, but they reflected many Malaysians’ growing frustration at Chinese brazenness.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The CCG vessel left the area around South Luconia Shoal during the ASEAN Summit and related meetings held in Kuala Lumpur in late November 2015, perhaps as a matter of face. The intractability of the South China Sea issue had been highlighted earlier that month when no joint statement was issued by the 18 members of the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting Plus due to bitter divisions over reference to the dispute. Nonetheless, Malaysia put to rest any concerns that it would be an obsequious chair vis-à-vis China. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The chairman’s statements of the ASEAN Summit and the East Asia Summit each contained five paragraphs dedicated to the South China Sea, expressing concern about the possibility of militarization of outposts and the erosion of trust and confidence. The chairman’s statements of the ASEAN-China Summit and the ASEAN-U.S. Summit each contained two paragraphs referencing the South China Sea, though the former omitted any mention of land reclamation or militarization. All the statements affirmed the importance of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) and of concluding a binding Code of Conduct (COC), as well as the observance of international law. The East Asia Summit chairman’s statement even referenced the assurances given by President Xi Jinping during his earlier visit to the United States that China would not pursue militarization in the South China Sea. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Malaysian armed forces chief Zulkifeli Mohd Zin observed during the October 2015 Xiangshan Forum in Beijing that time will judge China’s—and every party’s—sincerity in the South China Sea. Time, however, is not a luxury all claimant states have. There is already doubt that the CCG vessel’s departure from South Luconia Shoal was permanent. And the scale and intensity of environmental destruction caused by China’s land reclamation work in the Spratly Islands means that marine resources may be substantially depleted by the time there is any effective and meaningful implementation of the DOC or COC.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Despite growing apprehension both internally and externally, the Malaysian government will continue to rely on diplomacy and restraint for its policy in the South China Sea. Instruments such as the DOC and COC, and proposals for an expanded Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea and an analogue for overflights, will remain highly valued by Malaysian officials. So too will adherence to international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Meanwhile the Malaysian government might be better off tempering its own expectations of a mutually recognized or reciprocal special relationship with China. If both sides were really placing stock in such a relationship, then it should be reflected across the board, including in the South China Sea. This does not mean that Malaysia should or will begin choosing sides between China and others in any conceivable future. But it means that in the face of rising Chinese assertiveness and a rapidly changing South China Sea landscape, Malaysia will no longer be as averse to recalibrating its policy as needed to protect, preserve, and advance its national interest. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Malaysia may, in fact, already be at that point.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Time is of the Essence in South China Sea Arbitration Case</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The timing of the decision by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague on the Philippines’ case against China’s nine-dash-line claims has critical geopolitical implications for Asia’s security. Specifically, a decision delivered well before the Philippine presidential election this May would allow the administration of President Benigno Aquino to respond strategically and with continuity, whatever the outcome. A decision delivered after May would in effect roll the dice by putting a new leadership team in Manila in charge of managing the court’s determination.

For policymakers, the implications should be clear. If the court decides China’s claims are not legal, then the Philippines, ASEAN, and countries across the world who believe that rule of law should govern the seas will need to carefully and constructively encourage Beijing to recognize and embrace this core tenet of international governance and security.

The Philippines brought its case before the court against China in 2013, challenging Beijing’s vast territorial claim that encircles <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-sea-boundary-idUSBRE84O07520120525">nearly 90 percent</a> of the South China Sea. The Chinese government refused to respond to the case, insisting that the court had no jurisdiction, and refused to attend the hearing when the Philippine team made its arguments.

Since China declined to present any comments by the January 1, 2016 deadline, the court moved into the deliberations phase and declared its intent to issue a decision in 2016. The window for the court to make an impact on the international relations of the South China Sea is closing fast, but just as critical is Manila’s response and a coordinated global message to Beijing to embrace the rule of law in the interest of regional stability and peace.

December surveys from polling firms Social Weather Stations and Pulse Asia found returning strong support for current vice president Jejomar Binay, a reversal of his once-flagging fortunes. With erstwhile polling superstar Senator Grace Poe facing threats of disqualification on citizenship and residency requirements, Binay has charged back to the fore, much to the dismay of President Aquino and his chosen successor, Mar Roxas.

President Aquino and the Liberal Party are dismayed at the prospect of Binay becoming the next president because of the many ways he diverges from the current administration’s policies. Differences grew so great between the president and the vice president that Binay resigned from Aquino’s cabinet in June 2015, freeing him to criticize the Aquino government openly. One of the first topics he chose to criticize the president on was relations with China.

Although he has publicly affirmed that he would continue the arbitration process, it is hard to see how Binay would take up a court ruling in Manila’s favor while courting Beijing. In an interview with a Philippine radio station before his resignation, Binay pushed for closer ties with Beijing, calling for a bilateral resolution to maritime disputes and even joint ventures to explore energy resources in the South China Sea. Ever the businessman, <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/89880-binay-china-philippines-south-china-sea">Binay pointed out</a> that “China has money, [the Philippines] needs capital.”

Other candidates in the race have also weighed in on the arbitration and provided a mixed bag of responses. Senator Miriam Santiago, a legal expert and judge who was <a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/125249/what-went-before-international-criminal-court">the first Asian from a developing country elected to the International Criminal Court</a>, supports the arbitration case, but on other counts has diverged sharply from the policies of the Aquino administration. Santiago, who is strongly opposed to the presence of U.S. military forces in the Philippines, led much of the effort in the Senate against the implementation of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement with the United States before the Philippine Supreme Court on January 11 finally ruled the agreement constitutional, giving it the go-ahead. It is unclear whether Santiago would risk defying China after shirking U.S. military support.

Rodrigo Duterte, the hardnosed mayor of Davao City known for his support of vigilante murder squads, had colorful language for how he would stand up to Chinese bullying tactics. Despite his tough talk, Duterte <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/114778-rodrigo-duterte-leader-i-want">said he would pursue bilateral talks</a> and a less confrontational approach with China to resolve the disputes.

Grace Poe and Mar Roxas are the two candidates most likely to carry on Aquino’s course and follow up the court’s decision with actions supporting the authority of international convention. Poe, though independent, aligns closely with the Liberal Party. Roxas is a longtime member of the Liberal Party and has repeatedly supported the president’s approach to China. But Poe’s likelihood of staying in the race is looking increasingly unlikely as she appeals her disqualification by the Commission on Elections, and Roxas polled in <a href="http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/548750/news/nation/vp-binay-leads-in-latest-pulse-asia-survey-on-2016-presidential-bets">the middle</a> of <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/749683/sws-presidential-survey-binay-poe-tied-on-top-duterte-gains">the pack</a> for both presidential surveys released in December.

If the court hopes to pass down a decision which will not be thoroughly ignored as realpolitik overtakes it, it needs to ensure that the Aquino administration has ample time to institutionalize its approach. Since there are no formal enforcement mechanisms for the decision, the messaging from the Philippines and the international community is of greater import. If the decision is released and a new administration ignores it to pursue the bilateral negotiations that China has demanded all along, it decreases the incentive for other small nations to turn to international law and arbitration. If the Philippines didn’t get anything out of pursuing its case, why should Vietnam or Malaysia follow in the future? As other avenues for fair resolution of disputes are shut, states will increasingly turn to military build-up in order to defend their interests with force.

Ultimately, resolving the South China Sea conundrum will require a combination of legal efforts, diplomacy, compromise, and cooperation. But the implementation of the court’s decision, in the short term, is as important to the relevance of international law as it is to the interests of the Philippines. Ensuring that implementation by allowing President Aquino enough time to develop a response to the ruling is critical.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I visited Itu Aba, or Taiping Island in Chinese, on December 12 alongside a group of high-ranking Taiwanese government officials to attend the opening ceremonies for new piers and a lighthouse. It was my fourth visit to the island.

These visits provided me an opportunity to answer for myself the following questions being asked of a tribunal considering the Philippines’ case against China at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague: Is Itu Aba an “island” or “rock” under Article 121(3) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)? In other words, is it capable of sustaining human habitation or economic life of its own? And as a result, is the feature entitled to a 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and continental shelf?

The government of the Philippines argues in its arbitration case that none of the features in the Spratly Islands are capable of sustaining human habitation or economic life of their own, and are therefore legally “rocks.” This includes Itu Aba, the largest feature in the Spratlys. Accordingly, none of the features generate maritime entitlements beyond a 12-nautical-mile territorial sea. The Philippines’ claim is based on a number of arguments, including: (1) there is no fresh water on the island suitable for drinking or capable of sustaining a human settlement; and (2) there is no soil on the island capable of facilitating any kind of agricultural production that could sustain human habitation.

In accordance with Article 9 of Annex VII of UNCLOS, “[b]efore making its award, the arbitral tribunal must satisfy itself not only that it has jurisdiction over the dispute but also that the claim is well founded in fact and law.” Is the Philippines’ claim regarding fresh water and soil on Taiping Island well founded in fact? In my experience, no. On my four visits to Itu Aba, I ate crops grown on the island and drank from the skimming water well located near its small hospital.

During the second oral hearing in the arbitration case held in November 2015, the Philippines cited as the “most authoritative evidence” in support of its claim regarding the lack of fresh water and topsoil on Itu Aba a 1994 article entitled “The flora of Taipingtao [Itu Aba].” The article was written by three Taiwanese botanists and appeared in <em>Taiwania: International Journal of Life Sciences</em>, published by National Taiwan University’s College of Life Science. The research behind the article focused on the flora on Itu Aba, not the quality of water or availability of topsoil. The three authors are botanist, not experts on water quality or soil, and the views expressed in the article do not in any way represent those of Taiwan’s government. Given these facts, how can the article be cited as authoritative evidence that there is no fresh water or soil on Itu Aba?

It is interesting to note the reasons given by Professor Clive Schofield of the University of Wollongong, Australia, who spoke as an expert witness during the oral hearings at The Hague, to explain his change of opinion concerning the legal status of Itu Aba. Schofield previously wrote that “water supply might be one of the most important factors in clarifying the situation [legal status of an island or a rock]. This is because the existence of fresh water is an important indication that human habitation could be sustained.” At that time, he was of the opinion that Itu Aba "may conceivably" be considered a full-fledged island. But during the hearing, Schofield said his “firm belief” is that Itu Aba is a “rock.” Why the sudden change? It seems he accepted the so-called “most authoritative evidence” provided by the Philippines’ legal team.

It is not convincing to cite the 1994 article in support of the Philippines’ claim that there is no drinkable water or topsoil on Itu Aba. Schofield accepted this publication at its face-value without any verification. In addition, he admitted that he has not had access to Itu Aba. But I suspect he would change his opinion if he were invited to visit the island and, like me, had the chance to drink fresh water from the skimming well and eat a lunch of cooked vegetables and fruits picked from the island’s garden.

During my four visits to Itu Aba, I have seen indigenous plants that are more than 32 feet (10 meters) tall. There is a nearly 4,000-foot (1,200-meter) runway, two piers, a guest-house building, a postal office, a small hospital, a big agricultural garden, livestock, and a temple. In addition to drinkable water that is available at the four skimming wells, indigenous soil on the island has also long been used for growing fruits, including banana, coconut, and papaya, and vegetables such as wild bitter squash, loofah, and cabbage. It should also be noted that internet and cell phone access are available on Itu Aba, along with solar power for electricity.

If the five arbitrators deciding the South China Sea case were invited to conduct a visit to Taiping Island, I suspect it would be very helpful in the tribunal’s efforts to meet the requirement under Article 9 of Annex VII of UNCLOS to “satisfy itself not only that it has jurisdiction over the dispute but also that the claim is well founded in fact and law.”]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Getting the Balance Right: Singapore and Sino-U.S. Rivalry in the South China Sea</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In November, Singapore hosted a visit by Chinese president Xi Jinping. Notwithstanding the conclusion of several bilateral agreements, the spotlight invariably focused on Xi’s comments on the South China Sea, where he reiterated China’s commitment to freedom of navigation and the peaceful resolution of the South China Sea disputes.  Xi’s assurances were timely given regional consternation at China’s ambitions driving massive land reclamation projects in the disputed area. The following month, Singapore’s defense minister, Ng Eng Hen, and his U.S. counterpart, Ashton Carter, signed an Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) which aimed to further deepen an already strong bilateral defense relationship. Among other things, the EDCA provided for U.S. P-8 surveillance flights to be flown out of the island-state. While the South China Sea was not mentioned explicitly, analysts have inferred the P-8 will likely operate in that domain. How should these two developments be understood in the broader context of regional geostrategic trends?

Singapore is not a claimant in the South China Sea disputes, and has consistently maintained its position that the disputes themselves can only be resolved by the various claimant states. This does not mean however, that the island-state has no interest in the South China Sea. As a trading nation heavily reliant on maritime commerce, Singapore has taken a keen interest in the South China Sea, and its leaders have voiced concern for how the situation has deteriorated in recent years. Singapore is also mindful of the fact that while the South China Sea is located geographically at the heart of Southeast Asia, it has become an arena of growing contestation between the United States and China. On that score, the Sino-U.S. bilateral relationship has arguably become one of the most, if not the most, consequential component of the strategic equation in the South China Sea and by extension, regional security in Southeast Asia.

By virtue of being one of the most open economies in the world, Singapore is inherently vulnerable to fluctuations in the global economy. One geostrategic implication of this fact of life is simply that any downturn in relations between the two largest economies – the United States and China - would doubtless have detrimental effects for the island-state. By dint of this reality, for Singapore stable relations between the United States and China is <em>sine qua non</em> for regional security. At the same time, a common refrain in Singapore policy circles is that the island-state does not want to have to choose between the two powers. What this means is that against the backdrop of an increasingly uncertain strategic environment and a Sino-U.S. relationship that vacillates between cooperation and competition, Singapore has no choice but to tread a careful line so as to strike a balance between the two major powers; not so much in terms of the academic abstractions of balance of power theory, but as a policy imperative. This is something that officeholders and decisionmakers in Singapore are acutely aware of, meaning that no effort has been spared to foster strong bilateral relations with both powers, or even to make modest attempts to facilitate the deepening of understanding of both toward each other.

The centrality of the U.S. forward presence in Asia has long been acknowledged by Singapore to be integral to regional stability in how it served as a countervailing force to Soviet and Chinese ambitions during the Cold War, managed the prospects (and potential pitfalls) of Japanese re-militarization, and provided the conditions for economic growth and development. While Singapore has never been a formal alliance partner of the United States, relations between the two countries have always been close. Singapore was a firm supporter of the U.S. presence in the region during the Cold War, expressed most vividly in the latter’s involvement in the Vietnam War at considerable cost. Amid the changes that has swept through the region since the end of the Cold War, that objective of facilitating an American presence in Southeast Asia has remained a consistent policy theme.

At the same time, Singapore has viewed China’s peaceful rise to prosperity as crucial for its, and the region’s, interests on at least three counts. First, Chinese prosperity will doubtless have a positive spillover effect for the rest of the region.  Second, from a strategic perspective, a weakened China could pose major security threats to the region. As former prime minister Goh Chok Tong once vividly portrayed, “a prosperous and globally integrated China is in all our interests. The alternative of a poor and isolated China will be like having sixty North Koreas at our doorstep. It will pose challenges without the opportunities.” Finally, Singapore’s leaders are fully aware that growing Chinese influence in Southeast Asia is an inescapable reality, and hence a key objective would be to do whatever they can to nudge China to wield this influence in ways that would advance the cause of regional stability and economic progress. Nevertheless, while ties with China have been on an upswing in the last two decades, Singapore’s leaders are also cognizant of the unsettling effects of China’s weighty assertiveness, particularly if it perceives itself to be provoked. This was brought home when Beijing reacted strongly to then-deputy prime minister Lee Hsien Loong’s unofficial visit to Taiwan in July 2004, and continues to find expression in hawkish Chinese statements and policies in the South China Sea.

On the South China Sea, treading a careful line between the United States and China is a difficult balance to bring off, particularly given the heat of the current climate as both powers escalate their activities in the region. But for a small state like Singapore constrained by size and resources, realistic policy alternatives are few and far between. To be sure, the island-state has managed adroitly to strike a tenable balance for several decades. Yet its policymakers are all too aware that at the end of the day the effectiveness of such a strategy ultimately rests on the ability of the United States and China to achieve an appreciation and accommodation of each other’s interests in the region, and this is something that Singapore or any other regional state has little, if any, influence over.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Philippine Supreme Court Approves EDCA: Unlocking the Door for the Return of U.S. Strategic Footprint in Southeast Asia</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On January 12 the Philippine Supreme Court came out with a courageous decision reaffirming the constitutionality of the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) between the Philippines and the United States. In a 10 to 4 decision, the Supreme Court upheld the EDCA, paving way for the return of forward-deployed U.S. forces to select Philippine military bases.

This comes more than two decades after U.S. troops left the country in 1992 following the Philippine Senate’s non-concurrence with the Philippine-American Cooperation Treaty of 1991, which would have allowed for the continued stay of two major U.S. military facilities—Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base. The 10-year EDCA is considered a calculated effort by Manila and Washington to make the Philippines again a major staging base for projecting U.S. naval and air power in the face of China’s maritime expansion in the South China Sea.

Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin and U.S. ambassador to the Philippines Philip Goldberg signed the EDCA on April 28, 2014, a few hours before President Barack Obama arrived in Manila for his first state visit. The EDCA is not a new agreement since it merely updates and enhances the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty. The EDCA allows U.S. forces to utilize facilities owned and controlled by the Armed Forces of the Philippines, but ensures that the Philippine base commander retains unhampered access to those locations. Likewise, the U.S. military will be able to build or improve the infrastructure inside these installations, but Philippine forces will be able to jointly use them. Furthermore, any construction and other activities within Philippine bases requires the consent of the Philippine-U.S. Mutual Defense Board and Security Engagement Board.

Left-wing groups and two retired Philippine senators held up the approval of the EDCA, questioning its constitutionality by arguing that it is not an executive agreement but rather a treaty requiring approval from the Philippine Senate. In November 2015, the Philippine Senate passed a resolution asking the Supreme Court to compel the executive branch to submit the agreement to the upper chamber in the form of a treaty requiring concurrence by at least two thirds of senators. The Senate’s position paper on the agreement was submitted to the Supreme Court during its deliberations on the EDCA in late 2015.

These legal issues raised by political activists and retired and current senators pushed the EDCA into a legal limbo. For almost two years, the Philippine and U.S. governments waited in vain for a decision from the Philippine Supreme Court before the agreement could be implemented. The high court even postponed deliberations three times between November and December 2015 before finally issuing its ruling in early January.

<strong> </strong>The Supreme Court upheld the executive branch’s position that the EDCA is an implementing agreement of the 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) and the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty, which already provided for the rotational and temporary presence of U.S. forces in the Philippines. The high court noted that as an executive agreement, the EDCA is consistent with the existing Philippine laws and treaties that it seeks to implement, and with the 1987 Constitution which authorizes the chief executive to enter into an executive agreement on foreign military bases, troops, or facilities that “merely aims to implement an existing law or treaty.” The court declared that the EDCA as a form of executive agreement, is solely within the powers of the president, and does not require Senate concurrence. The Supreme Court ruling emphasized that that “EDCA is not the instrument that allows U.S. troops or facilities to enter (the Philippines) as the VFA has already done that.”

<strong>Beyond Constitutional Reaffirmation</strong>

The high court’s deliberations on the EDCA occurred in the face of China’s continuing building of artificial islands in the South China Sea. The court’s decision thus reflects the Philippines’ concern over Chinese island-building activities in the Spratlys, and the urgency of granting the Philippine executive certain leeway in foreign and defense affairs. The Supreme Court ruled that “the President must be accorded wider discretion in making decisions regarding external affairs, limited only by the letter of the law.” The decision emphatically stated that “no court can tell the President to desist from choosing an executive agreement over a treaty to embody an international agreement,” unless clearly disallowed by the constitution.

<strong> </strong>Once the EDCA is implemented, a small contingent of U.S. forces will be deployed in Philippine territory temporarily and on a rotational basis. This will probably include the stationing of a squadron of U.S. Marine fighter planes in a Philippine Air Force base for six months. This squadron will likely be replaced by a U.S. Navy fighter-bomber squadron that will be stationed in another Philippine Air Force or Navy base for six months. U.S. forces will be stationed in the country through two types of access arrangements:
<ol>
	<li>Forward operating sites—expandable, partially equipped facilities with a limited U.S. military support presence.</li>
	<li>Cooperative security locations—facilities maintained by the Philippines with little or no constant U.S. presence. These are less expensive, less visible, and less vulnerable, offering greater strategic and operational flexibility. They are less likely to create local political problems.</li>
</ol>
A temporary U.S. military presence will strengthen the Philippines’ resolve to uphold its territorial and maritime claims in the South China Sea. By increasing the United States’ ability to respond to crises in the South China Sea, the EDCA could also test American credibility regarding its defense commitment to the Philippines. Though the maritime row in the South China Sea will be a long-term security challenge and will never be solved solely through force, the potential for an armed conflict requires the presence of an effective U.S. deterrent force in the region. The EDCA is aimed at producing such a deterrence posture.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>South China Sea FONOP 2.0: A Step in the Right Direction</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Navy destroyer USS <em>Curtis Wilbur</em> passed within 12 nautical miles of Triton Island, the southernmost of the Paracel Islands, on January 30 in the second operation in the South China Sea in recent months under the Department of Defense’s <a href="http://amti.csis.org/fonops-primer/">Freedom of Navigation Program</a>. And despite <a href="http://news.usni.org/2016/01/30/u-s-destroyer-challenges-more-chinese-south-china-sea-claims-in-new-freedom-of-navigation-operation">significant disappointment</a> in some quarters, the operation was a considerable improvement over the October 26 transit of the USS <em>Lassen </em>near Subi Reef in the Spratly Islands.

In the wake of the previous Freedom of Navigation Operation (FONOP), the administration’s top concern appeared to be to downplay the transit in order to prevent upsetting Beijing more than necessary. As a result, no U.S. officials would speak on the record about the operation for days, despite extensive coverage in every major media outlet. This left the door open for unattributed statements and speculation to fill the gap. As should have been expected, the result was significant confusion about what exactly the <em>Lassen</em> was objecting to with its FONOP. In reality, it took nearly two months before a U.S. official fully and <a href="http://news.usni.org/2016/01/05/document-secdef-carter-letter-to-mccain-on-south-china-sea-freedom-of-navigation-operation">publicly explained</a> the operation and its intentions.

By contrast, the Department of Defense was ready with a <a href="https://seasresearch.wordpress.com/2016/01/31/full-statement-of-us-dept-defense-on-uss-curtis-wilburs-fonop-past-triton-island/">statement</a> on the <em>Curtis Wilbur</em>’s FONOP within hours. Not only did the Pentagon take control of the messaging so it could not spin out of control, as happened following the <em>Lassen</em>’s operation, but it did so with relative clarity. Where did the operation take place? “Within 12 nautical miles of Triton Island.” What did the destroyer do? “Transited in innocent passage.” What excessive maritime claim was it contesting? “Policies [of China, Taiwan, and Vietnam] that require prior permission or notification of transit within territorial seas.”

Equally important is that the planning of the recent FONOP seems to have been undertaken with the legal clarity and depoliticized nature typical of the Freedom of Navigation Program. Triton’s status as a legal rock or island (most likely the former) under international law is clear—it is above water at high tide and there are no nearby features whose maritime entitlements could complicate the undertaking or meaning of a FONOP. Subi Reef, by contrast, is a submerged feature that lies within 12 nautical miles of an unoccupied rock, which creates legal ambiguity about whether or not it bumps out the territorial sea of that rock and whether there is a legal requirement for innocent passage within 12 nautical miles of it.

The difference in clarity between the two operations is evident in the official explanations of their purposes. Compare the language of the Pentagon statement regarding the <em>Curtis Wilbur</em>’s transit to Defense Secretary <a href="http://news.usni.org/2016/01/05/document-secdef-carter-letter-to-mccain-on-south-china-sea-freedom-of-navigation-operation">Ashton Carter’s explanation</a> of the <em>Lassen</em>’s operation:
<blockquote>Given the factual uncertainty, we conducted the FONOP in a manner that is lawful under all possible scenarios to preserve U.S. options should the factual ambiguities be resolved, disputes settled, and clarity on maritime claims reached. The specific excessive maritime claims challenged in this case are less important than the need to demonstrate that countries cannot restrict navigational rights and freedoms around islands and reclaimed features contrary to international law as reflected in the LOS Convention.</blockquote>
The secretary’s explanation of the legal uncertainties surrounding Subi Reef are accurate. But the more important question is left unanswered: Why perform a FONOP there at all? If the United States wanted to challenge restrictions placed by China on innocent passage, there are five Chinese-occupied features in the Spratly Islands that indisputably generate a territorial sea or bump out the territorial sea of a nearby feature. If it wanted to challenge the right of a feature to generate a territorial sea at all, then Mischief Reef is the only Chinese-occupied feature that indisputably does not have one. Instead Subi was presumably chosen, at least in part, because the legal ambiguity surrounding it would allow the administration to avoid explaining exactly what it was objecting to, thereby avoiding undue controversy.

Not only did that plan backfire, but it also forced the administration to rationalize the operation in a way that appears inconsistent with the goals of the FON Program. As Commander <a href="http://amti.csis.org/how-the-u-s-fon-program-is-lawful-and-legitimate/">Jonathan Odom</a>, who formerly had a hand in guiding the program, has explained, U.S. FONOPs are always undertaken with great legal deliberation, and their rationale explained as transparently as possible, to make clear precisely how and why the United States objects to <em>specific</em> excessive maritime claims.

Nevertheless, the recent FONOP has many upset that the administration is being overly-cautious. And admittedly, engaging in innocent passage without prior notification amounts to the low-hanging fruit of potential FONOPs in the South China Sea. Passing within 12 nautical miles of Mischief Reef while engaged in activities that are clearly not consistent with innocent passage and therefore asserting that the United States does not recognize a territorial sea from the formerly-submerged feature would cut to the heart of the matter. It would be a much more effective way to contest China’s attempts to restrict freedom of navigation near its artificial islands.

It was a let-down that the Pentagon directed this FONOP toward the Paracels instead of the Spratlys. And some might see it as a disappointment that it merely engaged in innocent passage instead of contesting other claims such as China’s illegal straight baselines around the Paracels. But for the FON Program to be effective, it must eventually contest any and all excessive maritime claims, and it must do so regularly and without becoming overly politicized. If the U.S. government is to follow through on its commitment to undertake FONOPs with increasing frequency in the South China Sea, then a wide range of operations will need to be undertaken, contesting the entire spectrum of excessive claims being made by China and other claimants in the South China Sea.

After the criticism it received in the wake of the <em>Lassen</em>’s operation, it should not be all that surprising that the administration looked to the less controversial end of that spectrum for its next FONOP. Compared to its predecessor, this operation was a success. And there will be plenty more FONOPs to come. But if another three months pass and China’s apparent claim of the right to restrict freedom of navigation based on artificial islands remains uncontested, then I will join the chorus of disappointment.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>EDCA Refocus: Eyes on the AFP’s Modernization Program</title>
		<link>http://amti.csis.org/edca-refocus-eyes-on-the-afps-modernization-program/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On January 12, the Philippine Supreme Court ruled that the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) between the Philippines and the United States is an executive agreement that does not require Senate approval. With the ruling in hand, the Philippines and the United States governments can begin in earnest to implement the 2014 deal, which mainly provides for the United States to deploy forces to Philippine bases on a rotational basis, pre-position humanitarian response and defense materiel in the country, upgrade infrastructure within Philippine bases for these purposes. Inked in time for U.S. president Barack Obama’s first visit to Manila and in the shadow of growing tensions with China in the South China Sea, the Aquino government intended for EDCA to complement the Philippines’ rebooted military modernization effort.

Two years before EDCA was signed, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) received a fresh mandate to modernize after the passage of the Revised AFP Modernization Act. The 2012 law has the effect of restarting the clock on the 1995 AFP Modernization Act, which was enacted after the United States withdrew from its then-bases in the Philippines in 1992. As a result of the withdrawal, the Philippines became an impotent treaty ally with no serious military force of its own to deter external threats. The 1995 law aimed to give some teeth to the AFP, which had been traditionally developed as an inward-facing institution focused on fighting insurgencies. Soon after that law was enacted, however, financial constraints brought about by the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis resulted in the modernization effort being effectively defunded until its mandate lapsed in 2010.

By 2012, the AFP was no further along as an externally-oriented force than it was in 1995. Worse, key defense capabilities had seriously deteriorated; for example, the Air Force decommissioned the last of its Vietnam War-era fighter planes in 2005. Without pressing external threats, the need to revamp the military slid further and further down the list of government priorities. When the alarm bells rang in Manila over the standoff with China in Scarborough Shoal, both the executive and legislative branches of government got behind a renewed effort to invest in the Armed Forces even as diplomatic and legal processes were pursued by the Department of Foreign Affairs.

As conceived, EDCA would work hand-in-hand with the AFP modernization effort. At the time of signing, EDCA’s initial 10-year period (the deal is renewable) overlapped with the 13 years remaining in the modernizing law. The United States would shoulder the cost of upgrading AFP infrastructure for both countries’ use, boost disaster response readiness through pre-positioned supplies, and facilitate further training between military men on both sides. Over roughly the same period, the AFP could focus on acquiring basic hardware and put the pieces in place to monitor and secure Philippine territory more independently. The delayed implementation of the EDCA, however, prevented the AFP from concentrating on those priorities. Uncertainty before the court’s decision forced the AFP to plan for the possibility that all of the assistance promised in EDCA might be blocked by the constitutional challenge and an unfriendly senate.

With that context in mind, the Supreme Court’s decision on EDCA is especially welcome if it will allow a greater portion of the Philippine conversation over national defense to shift back to the issues around the prioritization and conduct of the AFP’s modernization program. Because defense planning and procurement timelines span decades, debating the goals and trajectory of the AFP today will be important to defining how the AFP will stand in the future. In material terms, Filipinos already have a serious stake in seeing this program succeed; because of the modernization program, the Department of National Defense (DND) is the third-highest recipient of tax funds for 2016.

With $3.6 billion, defense now comes after education ($9.1 billion) and public works and highways ($8.4 billion), and ranks higher than spending on the interior ($3.2 billion), health ($2.7 billion), and social welfare and development ($2.2 billion). This is not a paltry sum to Filipino taxpayers, but neither is it exceptional when compared to the rest of <a href="http://cogitasia.com/analyzing-southeast-asias-military-expenditures/">Southeast Asia</a>. No one can afford for these funds to be squandered, just as Filipinos cannot afford to miss out on opportunities for external assistance while the military gets its house in order.

There are still misgivings over EDCA from varied quarters, who recognize that the situation does not resolve into a simple win-win scenario. At the domestic level, the presence of foreign forces calls to mind previous rape or murder cases and the outgrowth of the sex trade. At the strategic level, a stronger relationship with the United States raises concerns over undue U.S. influence over Philippine foreign policy. Relatively strong Filipino negative sentiment over China’s behavior in the South China Sea in recent years may tip the balance in favor of EDCA at the moment, but the degree of domestic support at present may not be sustained under all other possible conditions. For the Philippine and U.S. governments to implement the deal while satisfying both countries’ interests and easing Filipino fears will be a challenge all its own.

Paradoxically, these concerns should give greater impetus to EDCA’s proponents and detractors alike to channel their energies toward how the AFP can be maintained at a size and quality necessary to deter would-be aggressors and respond to threats of any nature. In the long run, the solutions to both sides’ fears can be found in raising our expectations of the DND and the AFP, investing in the capabilities with the greatest returns to our security, and having no tolerance for waste. With the Supreme Court’s decision, we should close the legal chapter in the book on EDCA and reorient our gaze to the AFP.

		<title>Sunnylands and America’s Pivot to ASEAN</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

China may be gaining the strategic upper-hand in the ongoing scramble in the South China Sea thanks to its newly-built <a href="http://amti.csis.org/airstrips-near-completion/">artificial islands</a>, but it is facing increasing backlash in the region. Neighboring states as well as external powers have stepped up their diplomatic pressure on Beijing, while coordinating their efforts at safeguarding freedom of navigation in the area. Crucially, the Philippine Supreme Court last month <a href="http://amti.csis.org/philippine-supreme-court-approves-edca-unlocking-door-return-u-s-strategic-footprint-southeast-asia/">cleared the main obstacle</a> to the implementation of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), allowing the United States to augment its military footprint in the Philippines.

Beijing’s relentless pursuit of its claims is <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/12/07/why-chinas-land-grab-is-backfiring-on-beijing/">undermining relations</a> with a host of countries, which have come to welcome a greater U.S. military footprint in the Asia Pacific. The region is gradually witnessing the start of what the late Gerald Segal <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ins/summary/v020/20.4.segal.html">characterized</a> as a “constrainment” strategy – a calibrated push against perceived manifestations of Chinese revanchism. In particular, President Barack Obama’s <a href="http://csis.org/publication/sunnylands-summit-provides-opportunity-bolster-us-southeast-asia-ties">February 15-16 summit</a> with leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at the Sunnylands resort in California represents a crucial opportunity to strengthen U.S. regional leadership and mobilize greater multilateral pressure on China.

<strong>Regional Pushback</strong>

For years, a combination of fear, economic dependence, and (primarily <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/28/us-southchinasea-usa-decision-insight-idUSKCN0SM2GN20151028">U.S.</a>) strategic ambivalence provided China <em>carte blanche </em>to dictate the trajectory of the South China Sea disputes. But Beijing’s massive reclamation activities across the Spratly Islands have shaken the region out of strategic stupor, prompting increasingly robust countermeasures by other regional players.

The final months of 2015 saw a diplomatically isolated China that had to grapple with a seemingly coordinated diplomatic pushback. During the November 2015 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Manila, Xi stubbornly rejected any discussion of the South China Sea disputes. But China’s reclamation activities were very much at the center of bilateral discussions between the Philippines and other countries, including the United States, Japan, Australia, and Vietnam.

Shortly after arriving in the Philippines, Obama <a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/131401/obama-says-ph-navy-will-receive-two-ships-from-us">made a highly symbolic visit</a> to the Philippine Navy's flagship, the BRP<em> Gregorio del Pilar</em>, which was at the heart of the Sino-Philippine standoff over Scarborough Shoal in 2012. Obama reiterated America’s "ironclad commitment" to its Southeast Asian ally. Vietnam <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/philippines-vietnam-affirm-united-front-on-china-sea-dispute/3061741.html">signed</a> a new strategic partnership agreement with the Philippines, with a focus on maritime security cooperation, while Japan <a href="http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/11/19/15/japan-philippines-approve-defense-equipment-transfer">signed</a> a strategic agreement that allows for the transfer of military hardware to the Philippines. Other countries such as South Korea and Russia also discussed expanding defense ties with the Philippines.

During the ASEAN and East Asia Summit meetings later that month, the Philippines along with a number of major powers reiterated their growing worries over China’s reclamation activities and their implications for freedom of navigation and overflight in the region. Despite China’s vehement opposition to any discussion of the disputes, the ASEAN foreign ministers renewed their advocacy for a legally-binding code of conduct in the South China Sea.

With the Philippines expecting a favorable verdict in its arbitration case against China in the coming months, there are discussions of a potential “legal multiplier” as neighboring countries such as Vietnam and <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/indonesia-also-may-challenge-china-south-sea-claims/3053221.html">Indonesia</a> also threaten similar suits against China. Crucially, the United States has joined the fray by conducting freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) within the territorial sea of Chinese-occupied features.

Key ally Australia <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-35099445">has stepped</a><u> up</u> maritime patrols in the area, reiterating Canberra’s concerns over threats to freedom of navigation. Thanks to last year’s passage of a controversial collective security bill, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Forces <a href="http://amti.csis.org/can-japan-join-u-s-freedom-of-navigation-operations-in-the-south-china-sea/">could also soon</a> play a crucial role in asserting freedom of navigation in the area. The <a href="http://amti.csis.org/edca-refocus-eyes-on-the-afps-modernization-program/">U.S.-Philippines EDCA</a> will facilitate the expansion of bilateral military exercises and enhance interoperability between the two countries’ armed forces, which are also <a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/01/15/1542693/philippines-us-vow-close-coordination-edca">contemplating joint patrols</a> in the Spratlys.

<strong>Courting Southeast Asia</strong>

The Obama administration has already overseen a significant deepening in U.S.-ASEAN relations. Under Obama’s watch, Washington signed the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation; stepped up multilateral engagement with a liberalizing Myanmar; appointed the first permanent mission by an outside country to the ASEAN Secretariat; established the Lower Mekong Initiative; and <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/07/a-tipping-point-in-the-u-s-china-vietnam-triangle/">fortified strategic ties</a> with emerging partners such as Vietnam. As the Obama administration enters its last year in office, it is doubling down on operationalizing the much-touted rebalance to the Asia Pacific, especially the deepening of ties with Southeast Asia.

The ultimate aim of U.S. strategy toward the South China Sea is to enhance America’s regional leadership and increase the costs to China of its maritime assertiveness, leading to a recalibration in Beijing’s strategic calculus. During the upcoming Sunnylands summit, President Obama is expected to push for a regional consensus on the necessity of preserving freedom of navigation in the South China Sea – a barely-veiled rebuke against China’s assertiveness in the area.

Last month, Secretary of State John Kerry made a high-profile visit to Laos and Cambodia, often considered Beijing’s strategic backyard. Kerry managed to garner the support of Laos, which recently underwent a potentially seismic <a href="http://cogitasia.com/leadership-changes-upcoming-obama-visit-give-u-s-new-opportunities-in-laos/">leadership change</a> and is the current chair of ASEAN, on the issue of South China Sea. In both <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/secretary-of-state-john-kerry-asia-asean-laos-north-korea/3161239.html">Laos</a> and <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/01/26/asia/kerry-cambodia-human-rights/">Cambodia</a>, Kerry offered economic incentives in the hopes of dampening their heavy dependence on China.

The Sunnylands summit will also have a significant economic dimension, with Obama expected to push for more robust trade and investment ties with the region. In particular, he is expected to discuss the prospect of the major ASEAN economies of Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/27/indonesia-will-join-trans-pacific-partnership-jokowi-tells-obama">Indonesia</a> and the <a href="http://www.rappler.com/business/economy-watch/113221-aquino-seeks-help-obama-ph-tpp">Philippines</a> have expressed interest, while Thailand’s junta is still <a href="http://asia.nikkei.com/magazine/20151203-INDIAN-OCEAN-CURRENTS/Politics-Economy/Thailand-s-military-and-civilian-ministers-appear-divided-over-diplomatic-strategy">wavering</a>. Getting those economies on board will go a long way in boosting U.S. economic leadership in Asia.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The recent deployment of Chinese surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) to Woody Island is a notable tactical development, but a far more significant strategic signal.

Tactically, the HQ-9 batteries deployed to Woody Island could target aircraft at ranges up to 125 miles (200 kilometers), covering much of the Paracel Islands, which are also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan. Such air defenses are a core element of the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) anti-access umbrella. China is rumored to have previously placed less-advanced defensive systems in the Paracels, and Vietnam on some of the Spratly Islands. However, imagery showing Chinese SAMs on disputed islands depicts a noteworthy step in the militarization of the Paracels because it shows the extension of China’s anti-access umbrella south from the mainland into the South China Sea.

On the other hand, Woody Island has long been prepared for air defenses using its 8,900 foot (2,700 meter) airstrip, radars, and aircraft shelters. PLA fighter aircraft flying from Woody Island would have a far greater range than the HQ-9 system. Moreover, fighter aircraft could challenge the freedom of overflight by foreign aircraft operating near the Paracels without resorting to actual combat. Mobile SAM systems are certainly less vulnerable than airstrips, but their deployment to Woody Island does not fundamentally alter the regional military balance.

Nevertheless, the placement of SAMs at Woody Island is a noteworthy strategic development for two reasons. First, it shows that Chinese leaders are militarizing South China Sea features despite efforts to convince Beijing to do otherwise. Second, recent history suggests that Chinese developments on disputed features in the Spratly Islands often mimic those on Woody Island, indicating that similar steps may be ahead in the more strategically important Spratlys.

In recent years, U.S. leaders have repeatedly called for a halt to “reclamation, construction, and militarization” in the South China Sea. Yet Chinese officials have responded that “China has the legitimate and legal rights to deploy defense facilities within its territory.” In September 2015, President Xi Jinping went so far as to state that China did “not intend to pursue militarization” in the Spratly Islands. However, as <a href="http://amti.csis.org/island-tracker/">previous AMTI imagery</a> has shown, China has continued reclamation, construction, and militarization at a variety of South China Sea features.

What additional steps might one expect to see in the months ahead? Woody Island has served as a model for Chinese development in the Spratly Islands, particularly at Fiery Cross, Mischief, and Subi reefs. The placement of SAMs at Woody Island suggests that surface-to-air systems may follow on these three reefs as well. Other steps might include hardened aircraft shelters and more advanced radar systems with longer ranges and over-the-horizon capabilities. Additionally, observers might expect to see routine rotations of aircraft, anti-ship cruise missile batteries, surface ships, and submarines through Chinese-held features in the South China Sea. To further assert China’s sovereignty claim, Beijing may also establish territorial baselines around the Spratlys similar to those it created in the Paracels in 1996.

Chinese actions suggest that its leaders are intent on providing the islands with both an anti-access umbrella and a power projection capability. Chinese features would certainly be vulnerable in a conflict, but they would provide a substantial edge over other regional claimants during a crisis and would present an additional military challenge to U.S. forces, which would already be stretched thin in a contingency. Such efforts would also help China enforce a South China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone in the months or years ahead.

Thus, the tactical importance of the deployment of SAMs to Woody Island pales in comparison to the signal the deployment sends about China’s long-term strategy in the South China Sea.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Tumultuous 2016 in the South China Sea</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This promises to be a landmark year for the claimant countries and other interested parties in the South China Sea disputes. Developments that have been underway for several years, especially China’s island-building campaign in the Spratlys and Manila’s arbitration case against Beijing, will come to fruition. These and other developments will draw outside players, including the United States, Japan, Australia, and India, into greater involvement. Meanwhile a significant increase in Chinese forces and capabilities will lead to more frequent run-ins with its neighbors.

Alongside these developments, important political transitions will take place around the region and further afield, especially the Philippine presidential elections in May. But no matter who emerges as Manila’s next leader, his or her ability to substantially alter course on the South China Sea will be highly constrained by the emergence of the issue as a cause célèbre among many Filipinos who view Beijing with wariness bordering on outright fear. The same dynamics are at play in Vietnam, where the course of South China Sea policy is <a href="http://cogitasia.com/vietnams-foreign-policy-after-the-12th-national-party-congress-expanding-continuity/">not expected to change</a> following last month’s Communist Party congress despite the re-election of Nguyen Phu Trong, who is generally seen as more pro-Beijing, as party chief.

The Philippines argued the merits of its <a href="http://amti.csis.org/a-case-of-rocks-islands/">case against China</a>’s claims in the South China Sea before an arbitral tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in November 2015. Afterward the five judges asked the Philippine legal team for written answers to a final round of follow-up questions. They are now expected to enter deliberations and issue a ruling around late May. That decision will be final and legally binding on both parties, despite Beijing’s refusal to take part in the proceedings or recognize the tribunal’s jurisdiction.

The case is complicated—it consists of 15 separate claims—and so the final shape of an award from the tribunal is unknown. However, the judges will almost certainly rule that China’s nine-dash line is not a valid maritime claim and that China is not entitled to any historic rights beyond the regime of territorial seas, exclusive economic zones, and continental shelves laid out in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This will not affect China’s territorial claims to the disputed islands and rocks of the South China Sea, nor will it necessarily mean that Beijing cannot make large claims to the seabed and waters in the area. But it will amount to an order that China clarify its maritime claims based on entitlements from land features, not ambiguous dashes on a map.

Beijing will not suddenly clarify its claims in the South China Sea because the tribunal orders it to do so. The Chinese government has repeatedly said that it will not recognize any ruling. But it has also worked hard since Manila brought the case in early 2013 to get the Philippine government to drop it. That is because being branded an international outlaw will involve significant reputational costs for Beijing. It will undermine China’s narrative that it is a responsible rising power that deserves a greater hand in global governance. It will make other countries wary of Chinese commitments and will drive regional states even closer to Tokyo and Washington.

These costs to Beijing could make an eventual political compromise more appealing. China might agree to redefine the nine-dash line based on UNCLOS rather than historic rights and enter real negotiations in exchange for the Philippines dropping the case (which will remain open until both parties abide by the award) and agreeing to undertake joint economic development.

In order to promote that kind of political compromise, Manila and Washington will need to embark on a sustained campaign to garner international support for the tribunal’s ruling. That support will need to come not only from like-minded countries like Australia, Japan, and European states, but also from the Philippines’ Southeast Asian neighbors.

China’s first civilian test flights landed at Fiery Cross Reef at the end of 2015, marking the completion of China’s first operational runway in the Spratly Islands. Additional <a href="http://amti.csis.org/airstrips-near-completion/">airstrips at Subi Reef and Mischief Reef</a> will soon join it, if they have not already, and military test flights to the features are expected in the first half of 2016. Meanwhile China continues to build port facilities, support structures, and radar installations to support substantial air, naval, and coast guard forces on rotation at these and four other features in the Spratlys. Add to this ongoing military upgrades at Woody Island, where China boasts another airstrip and recently deployed mobile surface-to-air missiles, and it is clear that 2016 will see the capabilities of Chinese forces in the South China Sea increase substantially.

The most direct victims of this increase in Chinese forces over the course of 2016 will be the naval, coast guard, and civilian fleets of Southeast Asian claimants. Simple arithmetic suggests that this year will see more frequent harassment of and clashes with Filipino, Malaysian, and Vietnamese fishermen, oil and gas exploration vessels, and military ships and planes as China increases its capacity to patrol more of the South China Sea and interdict vessels operating in what Beijing considers its sovereign space.

Increased Chinese naval and air capabilities in the South China Sea are already leading to calls from Southeast Asian claimants for greater involvement by outside powers. These voices will only grow louder as 2016 progresses and more Chinese facilities in the Spratlys come online. Already Australia has stepped up patrols under its Operation Gateway—an ongoing mission to patrol Southeast Asian waters and airspace—as the United States increases the frequency of its <a href="http://amti.csis.org/fonops-primer/">freedom of navigation patrols</a> in the area.

Japan is stepping up defense cooperation with regional partners, especially Australia and the Philippines, under its new defense guidelines and is hotly debating a larger role in patrolling the South China Sea. And the Indian navy is increasingly operating in the area while emerging as a key provider of arms and equipment to Vietnam and an increasingly important security partner to Australia, Japan, and the United States.

The ability of the United States to boost its intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and patrol capabilities in the South China Sea, and to respond in case of threats to the Philippines or other regional partners, will be significantly increased by the Philippine Supreme Court’s approval in January of the <a href="http://cogitasia.com/edca-refocus-eyes-on-the-afps-modernization-program/">Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement</a>. In the coming months, Manila and Washington will finalize the official list of Philippine military facilities to which U.S. forces will gain access as part of the agreement, and at which the United States will invest substantially to improve Philippine military infrastructure.

Given these dynamics, 2016 promises to be a much tenser year in the South China Sea, and one in which the groundwork could be laid for a sustained multilateral campaign to deter further Chinese aggression, support Southeast Asian states in pursuit of their rights, and reach an eventual political compromise to manage the disputes.

		<title>Vietnam’s South China Sea Approach after National Congress</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong was unanimously reelected during the 12th National Congress of Vietnam's Communist Party, held January 21-28. Trong, who is less strident than other Vietnamese leaders in his criticism of Beijing’s behavior in the South China Sea, has been seen as leading the party’s more conservative, pro-Chinese faction. But many in Hanoi believe that Trong’s attitude toward Washington has evolved positively since his “truly historic” Oval Office meeting with President Barack Obama in July 2015. That meeting took place a year after the months-long standoff over China’s deployment of the Haiyang Shiyou 981 (HY-981) deep-water oil rig, called Hai Duong 981 in Vietnamese, in disputed waters near the Paracel Islands.

As <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.vn/en/nr040807104143/nr040807105001/ns160128191736" target="_blank">Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh said at the National Congress</a>, Vietnam will try to maintain a multipolar balance in its overall relations with the major powers, including China, the United States, Japan, India, Russia, and the European Union. Within this context, it is safe to say that Vietnam’s South China Sea policy will remain consistent in the next few years, especially with regards to several key positions.

First, Vietnam will continue to assert its “indisputable sovereignty” over the Paracel (Hoang Sa) and Spratly (Truong Sa) archipelagos, and its legal rights and interests in maritime zones established in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Official sources have continuously reiterated this position on the Paracels and Spratlys, maintaining that Vietnam has sufficient historical evidence and the legal foundation to proclaim its sovereignty over the two archipelagoes. Vietnam’s National Assembly in June 2012 promulgated the Law of the Sea of Vietnam, which cemented in domestic law the inclusion of the islands within the territory of Vietnam. As such, Vietnam has consistently rejected the legitimacy of China’s claim over the islands and their adjacent waters, as well as China’s claim of unspecified historic rights to the waters, seabed, and subsoil within the nine-dash line.

Second, Vietnam will continue to support full compliance with and implementation of all provisions and procedures of UNCLOS, including the settlement of disputes concerning the interpretation and application of the treaty by peaceful means. This policy can be seen in Vietnam’s reaction to the award on jurisdiction and admissibility that the tribunal hearing the Philippines’ arbitration case against China issued on October 31, 2015. <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.vn/en/tt_baochi/pbnfn/ns151104142526" target="_blank">Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Le Hai Binh emphasized</a> that “Vietnam wishes the Tribunal will interpret and apply relevant provisions of the Convention in this case with a view to making an impartial and objective decision.”

Two weeks earlier, Vietnam’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations told the Sixth Committee of the General Assembly (dealing with “The rule of law at the national and international levels”),

[Vietnam is] deeply concerned about territorial and sovereignty disputes, especially unilateral attempts to change the rule, alter status quo in disputed areas in the South China Sea in defiance of international law, posing threats to peace, security and stability in the region. Vietnam calls upon all parties concerned to refrain from the threat or use of force and settle all disputes by peaceful means in accordance with international law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. We emphasize the importance of full and effective implementation of the Declaration of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, as well as early conclusion of a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea.

Third, Vietnam’s mild response to the USS Curtis Wilbur’s January 30 freedom of navigation operation within the 12-nautical-mile territorial sea of Triton Island in the Paracels, despite Hanoi’s official policy of requiring prior notification of transit within its territorial waters, indicated that Vietnam views such operations positively.

Following the operation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.vn/en/tt_baochi/pbnfn/ns160131221102" target="_blank">Binh said</a> “Once again, we reaffirm the indisputable sovereignty of Vietnam over the Hoang Sa as well as the Truong Sa Archipelagos. As a State Party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) 1982, Vietnam respects the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea conducted in accordance with relevant rules of international law, in particular the UNCLOS (Article 17). We request all countries to make positive and practical contribution to maintaining peace and stability in the East Sea [South China Sea] and to respect international law.”

Last but not least, when it comes to the ongoing arbitration case initiated by the Philippines against China, it is possible that some of the decisions made by the tribunal will have a direct impact on Vietnam’s claims in the South China Sea. In order to protect its legal rights and interests in the sea, <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.vn/en/tt_baochi/pbnfn/ns151104142526" target="_blank">Vietnam has expressed its position</a> to the tribunal regarding the case, requested the judges pay due attention to the legal rights and interests of Vietnam, and effectively reserved the right to intervene in the case should the need arise. However, it should be noted that the outcome of the arbitration may put pressure on the Vietnamese government to reconsider some of its policies on the South China Sea in order to preserve its national interests and sovereignty while still honoring its expressed support for international law.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Setting a high bar down under: An American perspective on Australia’s White Paper</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.defence.gov.au/whitepaper/" target="_blank">Australian Defence White Paper </a>was a long time coming, but it was worth the wait.

From an American perspective, the White Paper is a carefully crafted document that will leave many in Washington both pleased with and envious of Canberra's strategic conceptualisation and connection of ends and means. The White Paper notes that 'a strong and deep alliance is at the core of Australia's security' and that the US 'will remain the pre-eminent global military power and will continue to be Australia's most important strategic partner.' The centrality of the US rebalance to Asia is specifically noted. Meanwhile, the importance of US engagement is underscored by a clear message to American political leaders: 'The levels of security and stability we seek in the Indo-Pacific would not be achievable without the United States.'

The White Paper wisely chooses to frame Australia's China strategy as part of its commitment to uphold the rules-based global order. The document warns of 'challenges to the stability of the rules-based global order, including competition between countries and major powers trying to promote their interests outside of the established rules.' As a result, 'the rules-based global order is under increasing pressure and has shown signs of fragility.' Australia's willingness to support the global order is clearly noted by the recognition that 'future operations could include contributing to security in North Asia and helping to protect the extensive sea lines of communication that support Australian trade where our interests are sufficiently engaged.'

Thus, rather than framing Australia as facing a China choice, the White Paper makes clear that it is in fact China's choice whether to contest the rules-based global order that Australia and the US underpin. While the document is sometimes circumspect about directly criticising China's assertive behaviour in maritime Asia, it does note that 'Australia is particularly concerned by the unprecedented pace and scale of China's land reclamation activities' and 'Australia is opposed to any coercive or unilateral actions to change the status quo in the East China Sea.' Not surprisingly, Beijing has expressed 'dissatisfaction' with the report. Then again, Chinese satisfaction with the White Paper would have been alarming, to say the least.

Regarding spending levels, the White Paper warns against 'disconnected' strategy and budgets, making clear that Defence will avoid another strategy-resource divide as occurred during previous reviews. Instead, the government commits to reaching the 2% of gross domestic product target by 2021 and assures readers that the '10-year funding model will be not be subject to any further adjustments as a result of changes in Australia's GDP growth estimates.' Defence budget experts are no doubt hard at work verifying the cost estimates, but the basic framework puts Australia in a strong position. This recommitment to the Abbott spending levels is a strong sign to the entire region that leadership changes within the Coalition will not fundamentally alter the trajectory of Australia's defence strategy, as many in the region might have speculated.

On individual capabilities, the commitment to procure 12 submarines and 72 F-35s is welcome. These systems and associated capabilities will give Australia a strong buffer against further expansion of both the Chinese anti-access/area denial and power projection envelopes beyond the South China Sea. Increased amphibious capabilities will also enhance rapid reaction and inter-operability with other maritime nations in the Western Pacific at a time when island chain defence and humanitarian assistance and disaster response are becoming more prominent shared requirements.

In terms of posture, priority is placed on investment in 'northern Australia, including in Townsville and Darwin, as well as the Air Force bases Tindal, Curtin, Scherger and Learmonth.' Cocos Island is also specifically called out as a critical maritime domain awareness operating location. Basing and access enablers, such as fuel capacity, are also highlighted. These are the right areas from a US perspective, but behind the scenes both governments need to do much more to resolve cost sharing and other nagging issues that are obstructing best use of these facilities for Australian and (occasionally) US forces.

The White Paper's focus on international engagement is important, though this is one area where better guidance to the force would have been useful. The White Paper says Australia provides defence assistance to 28 countries and emphasises that 'international engagement will become an integrated core function across the entire Defence portfolio.' That is important, but not all defence diplomacy is created equal. Embedding Army captains with South Pacific forces, conducting exchanges with the People's Liberation Army, and developing advanced operational concepts with Japan for anti-submarine warfare are very different kinds of missions.

The challenge posed by China's denial strategy in the First Island Chain cannot be met without greater networking of US bilateral alliances to dissuade exactly the kind of 'coercive or unilateral efforts to change the status quo' the White Paper flags. From a US perspective, this means assisting less developed states with capacity-building at one level, while strengthening jointness and interoperability with major US allies and potential partners like India at another. The White Paper gives some hint of this prioritisation in the number of references to other states in the region: the US has 128 references, China 53 (more often as an object of assessment than as a potential partner), Japan 36, Indonesia 32, and India 24. France, Germany, the UK, and Canada, on the other hand, receive fewer mentions together than Papua New Guinea.

Understandably, the White Paper had to be scrupulously neutral with respect to the still undecided partner for the SEA 1000 future submarine program. A strategic statement unencumbered by that consideration might have placed greater emphasis on the need for networking and interoperability with other maritime powers in the region.

The Pentagon should take note of the White Paper not only for its relevance in terms of alliance relations, but also because of the clear metrics for connecting strategy, capabilities, and resources. The paper should be required reading for all US officials and officers working on the Quadrennial Defense Review's successor, the Defense Strategy Review.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At the recent U.S.-ASEAN leaders’ summit in Sunnylands, President Barack Obama spoke of the two sides advancing their “shared vision of a regional order where international rules and norms, including freedom of navigation, are upheld and where disputes are resolved through peaceful, legal means.” The oblique reference to the South China Sea was a declaration that the United States would not stand by idly as China unilaterally changed the maritime status quo, but tensions have only risen in the days since.

Apprehensions over the South China Sea dispute are born from the high stakes involved. Although unlikely, the global economic chaos created by a war in East and Southeast Asia would be unimaginable, and would result in decades of human tragedy. Even a comparatively minor conflict could bring world trade — 50 percent of which passes through the region — to a jarring halt.

To many in Washington and Beijing, the South China Sea dispute has become a proxy battle for influence over Asia. But ASEAN, arguably the second most successful regional organization in the world after the European Union, has a pivotal role to play in this contest. It will take careful engagement from all three parties to resolve the disputes peacefully. Ultimately, the South China Sea dispute poses three distinct tests for these players. They are the rules and norms test, the resource management test, and the operational test.

The rules and norms test requires China to respect international law when addressing the South China Sea dispute. As a peaceful and responsible permanent member of the Security Council, China – which has judges sitting in the International Court of Justice and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea – must not use the threat or use of force in the resolution of the maritime dispute. The world needs assurance that the newly-built islands in the South China Sea are not being militarized or used for power projection in the region.

The United States, which promotes freedom of navigation and adherence to global norms, must lead by example. The principal and most effective way to do this would be by ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). America’s credibility in advocating that nations abide by the principle of freedom of navigation and the law of the sea is reduced when Washington itself refuses to be party to the Constitution of the Ocean, UNCLOS. The deteriorating situation in the South China Sea provides a much-needed push for the United States to get its act together.

Members of ASEAN involved in the dispute must shore up the importance of rules and norms, too. Smaller nations dealing with larger ones must rely on international norms and rules to advocate for themselves. To accomplish this, parties in the South China Sea dispute that have not done so need to streamline their claims under international law. They must state clearly the features, the names, the exact location, and the legal basis of their claims. Practices incompatible with UNCLOS, such as Vietnam’s excessive baselines, need to be ended.

The resource management test requires the claimants themselves, the greater ASEAN community, and possibly the United States to collaborate on the conservation of marine resources in the South China Sea. The non-existence of a regional fisheries management organization in the disputed area has led to the absence of information on the depletion of fish stocks and deterioration of the health of the sea. This could lead to food insecurity, the increasing poverty of coastal communities, and increasing illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.

While the idea of joint development of mineral resources is wishful thinking, the six countries of the Coral Triangle Initiative—two of which, Malaysia and the Philippines, are South China Sea claimants—have demonstrated that collaboration to manage the health of the largest coral reef on earth is possible without having a settled maritime boundary. The security, safety, and environmental management of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore do not require a definitive maritime boundary or even the successful settlement of sovereignty disputes.

The organizational test requires the United States, ASEAN, and China to devise a mechanism to reduce the risk of collision or conflict at sea. The ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting can be an excellent platform to establish a practical mechanism aimed at defusing tensions, preventing escalation, managing maritime emergencies, and increasing operational safety. The three parties could establish sub-regional naval collaboration for joint exercises and joint operations other than war to create, strengthen, and maintain trust. The sharing of experiences in regional maritime law enforcement could also create the needed trust.

No one country can handle myriad global threats or the burden of international order all by itself; not even the collective power of all five permanent members of the Security Council can do so. International challenges require international cooperation and solutions.

Passing each of these three tests is needed to avoid an Asian tragedy from emerging in the South China Sea.

		<title>“Self-Restraint” with Japanese Characteristics</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Revelations of Chinese <a href="http://amti.csis.org/seeing-the-forest-through-the-sams-on-woody-island/">missile placements</a> and <a href="http://amti.csis.org/another-piece-of-the-puzzle/">radar facilities</a> in the South China Sea suggest it might be an opportune time to reflect on the meaning of “self-restraint” in the Asian maritime theater. It is precisely because self-restraint appears so lacking of late, and the disputes so volatile, that it should be actively reinserted into the conversation.

When <a href="http://eng.mod.gov.cn/TopNews/2015-05/31/content_4587686.htm">defending its policies</a> in the South and East China seas, Beijing has frequently said, “In spite of the sufficient historical and legal evidence and its indisputable claims of rights and interests, China has exercised enormous restraint, making positive contributions to peace and stability of the region.” But this highlights what many see as a major disconnect between rhetoric and reality.

Beijing’s claims of “enormous restraint” occur concomitant with China’s large-scale construction of artificial features and facilities for both civil and military purposes. Though other South China Sea disputants have <a href="http://amti.csis.org/another-piece-of-the-puzzle/">also engaged</a> in reclamation and construction activities, the pace and scale of China’s behavior dwarfs that of any other.

Beijing’s repeated use of “restraint” [克制] is not accidental. The 2002 China-ASEAN <a href="http://www.asean.org/asean/external-relations/china/item/declaration-on-the-conduct-of-parties-in-the-south-china-sea">Declaration of Conduct</a> for Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) calls on all parties to “exercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability.” U.S. leaders, including President Barack Obama, have similarly called on all sides to exercise “restraint,” and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/04/us-usa-southchinasea-asean-idUSKBN0G421J20140804">pushed for</a> a freeze on provocative acts and conclusion of a binding code of conduct.

As efforts are made in pursuit of sincere “self-restraint,” Japan’s longstanding policies vis-à-vis the Senkaku Islands (<em>Diaoyu</em> in Chinese), though rarely discussed, provide a model worthy of emulation. The well of mutual trust in the South China Sea is undoubtedly poisoned at present, but a binding, universally agreed-upon, and concrete definition of “self-restraint” consistent with the spirit of the 2002 DOC remains necessary. The relevant obstacles to doing so are fundamentally political, though this is not to say they will be easily solved.

&nbsp;

<strong>Looking Northeast: Political Will as the Variable</strong>

<strong> </strong><a href="http://jpr.sagepub.com/content/51/2/185">History shows</a> that territorial disputes can be major drivers of interstate conflict; yet they are not inherently intractable. How two (or more) parties choose to address a dispute is fundamentally a question of political will.

Asia provides several <a href="http://amti.csis.org/maritime-disputes/">recent examples</a> of successful management, and even final resolution, of previously intractable disputes—including those <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/016228805775124534">involving China</a>. For its part, Japan has for decades administered the Senkaku Islands—also claimed by mainland China and Taiwan. Yet despite perceived Chinese provocations, Japan’s leaders have repeatedly chosen <em>not </em>to provocatively develop or militarize the islands. Furthermore, together with Taipei (which shares Beijing’s claim) they have shown that dispute resolution is not a prerequisite for constructive and creative measures to reduce tensions. The two governments have prioritized positive, stable political relations.

Indeed it was precisely as the possibility of Japan “nationalizing” three of the islands heated up in August 2012 that Taiwan proposed the <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=A3C75D6CF8A0D021">East China Sea Peace Initiative</a>. President Ma called on all sides to “replace confrontation with dialogue, shelve territorial disputes through negotiations, formulate a Code of Conduct in the East China Sea and engage in joint development of resources.” He said that “while sovereignty is indivisible, resources can be shared.” In April 2013, following 17 rounds of negotiations, Taipei and Tokyo signed a bilateral <a href="http://amti.csis.org/the-japan-taiwan-fishery-agreement-strategic-success-tactical-failure/">fisheries agreement</a> in the hopes of ending a four-decade source of bilateral friction.

Importantly, Taipei proposed this initiative at the height of the controversy surrounding Tokyo’s nationalization of the islands and despite reiterating that on historical, geographical, and international legal grounds, Taiwan considers its sovereignty over the territory “indisputable.”  This constructive approach demonstrates that even if seemingly intractable definitions of sovereignty exist, a destabilizing spiral of political friction, much less military tensions or conflict, is by no means inevitable.

&nbsp;

<strong>Restraint with Japanese Characteristics: Big Dogs That Didn’t Bark </strong>

<strong> </strong>Beijing’s definitions of its own “self-restraint” in the South China Sea is inextricable from its stance that “indisputable” historical and legal evidence supports its claim. Beijing is hardly alone in taking such a firm position. Indeed, Tokyo’s <a href="http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/senkaku/basic_view.html">official position</a> on the Senkaku Islands—like those of Beijing and Taipei—is predicated on an almost identical belief: that “historical facts” and “international law” make it “indisputable” that the islands are an “inherent part” of Japan. Remarkably, Beijing and Tokyo even use identical characters to assert their respective claims’ “inherent” nature (Chinese: 固有领土; Japanese: 固有の領土).

But in contrast to Beijing’s actions in the South and East China seas, Tokyo’s behavior vis-à-vis the Senkakus has actually reflected the DOC’s<a href="http://cil.nus.edu.sg/rp/pdf/2002%20Declaration%20on%20the%20Conduct%20of%20Parties%20in%20the%20South%20China%20Sea-pdf.pdf"> call</a> for “self-restraint in the conduct of activities that would complicate or escalate disputes.” This is ironic since the agreement does not cover the East China Sea, nor is Tokyo a party to it, while Beijing and other South China Sea claimants are. Japan’s leaders have repeatedly chosen not to develop, much less militarize, the islands. Government records of discussions among political leaders dating back to the 1970s reveal that they have consistently prioritized the islands’ “peaceful and stable” management (平穏かつ安定的な維持及び管理).

This restraint is particularly notable given widespread international recognition that Japan has administered the islands at least since Okinawa “reverted” to Japanese control in 1972, and for 50 years before the U.S. occupation—a period for part of which Japanese nationals actually lived and worked there. Tokyo’s commitment to self-restraint has held despite <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/east-asia/2015-03-23/crowding-waters">major changes</a> in Beijing's behavior since 2012 and the issue’s devolution to become the most volatile flashpoint in Sino-Japanese relations. In a revealing case-in-point of the depth of commitment to self-restraint, basic policy has not changed under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe—a leader who <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/16/japanese-hawk-victory-fears-tension">pledged</a> while campaigning for the prime ministership to develop the islands, and who Beijing considers “nationalistic” and “anti-China.”

&nbsp;

<strong>Desperately Seeking Statesmen</strong>

Japan’s self-restraint continues despite its <a href="http://www.adamphailliff.com/documents/Liff2014_PrinciplesWithoutConsensus.pdf">refusal to acknowledge</a> even the <em>existence</em> of a dispute. Ironically, and unfortunately, it is <em>because </em>Japan does not behave provocatively that its policy never makes headlines. Yet its constructive behavior demonstrates that even when a government claims territory “inherently,” acknowledges no dispute, <em>and</em> exercises effective administrative control, it still can <em>choose</em> self-restraint in the interest of regional stability. Meanwhile, Tokyo’s and Taipei’s initiatives demonstrate that when two are willing to hear the music, they can indeed tango.

As relevant parties search for a framework to manage South China Sea tensions, a consensus, binding definition of “self-restraint” faithful to the spirit of the 2002 DOC is the Holy Grail. The deck today seems stacked against it. Unconstructive activities driving changes to the status quo are unlikely to be reversed. Political will among relevant parties remains in doubt. Nevertheless, as observers naturally focus on tension and conflict, constructive alternatives must be proactively kept a part of the conversation.

That Japan’s decades-old policy of self-restraint is so often ignored is perhaps evidence that, at least until recently, it proved so effective.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The South China Sea has lately evolved from a territorial and maritime dispute between only China and the other claimants to a showdown between the United States, as a strong maritime power and user of the South China Sea, and China, as a growing regional maritime power pursuing its maritime interests as a coastal state. China and the United States both have legitimate interests in the South China Sea, but diverge on issues including freedom of navigation, the Philippines-China arbitration case, state practice of international law, approaches to maritime dispute management, and land reclamation activities. The question is, will these divergences beat the two nations’ common interests and lead to a violent confrontation? My analysis suggests no.

<strong>Freedom of Navigation</strong>

<strong> </strong><a href="http://amti.csis.org/fonops-primer/">Recent patrols</a> by the USS <em>Lassen</em> and <em>Curtis Wilbur</em> were based on the U.S. policy of asserting freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. Both China and the United States view freedom of navigation as vital to their national interests, but they differ on the question of whether certain activities fall within the scope of freedom of navigation. China does not regard certain types of military activities within its exclusive economic zone as falling within the scope of “freedom of navigation,” including those potentially having an impact on its marine environment and those which could be categorized as marine scientific research without prior permission from the coastal state.

China and the United States also differ on whether warships enjoy the same right to innocent passage within another nation’s territorial sea as commercial vessels. The United States does, while Chinese domestic law requires prior permission for warships exercising innocent passage within its territorial sea. Article 30 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) stipulates that a coastal state may require a foreign warship to leave its territorial sea immediately if the ship does not comply with the laws and regulations of the coastal state. Despite this difference in interpretation, both sides acted in a cautious and lawful manner during the recent U.S. Freedom of Navigation Operations.

China’s official protests to the U.S. patrols was mostly driven by political and security concerns rather by the interpretation of international law. So, is freedom of navigation really an issue between China and the United States?

<strong>International Law and Dispute Settlement</strong>

<strong> </strong>The United States has called on China to act in conformity with international law and norms. But what principals under international law has China breached? It has not violated Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations calling for “peaceful means” of dispute settlement or Article 4 of 2002 ASEAN-China Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea on not “resorting to the threat or use of force.” Instead China has proposed since the 1980s to shelve sovereignty disputes and pursue joint development.

When the United State insists on China respecting international law, it is reflecting a difference in attitudes toward the state practice of managing or settling international disputes. The United States has explicitly endorsed the Philippines’ decision to pursue third party <a href="http://amti.csis.org/a-case-of-rocks-islands/">compulsory dispute settlement</a> through arbitration. China has rejected that approach for a number of reasons, including doubts about the jurisdiction and admissibility of the case, and its preference for other means of dispute settlement. Beijing also doubts that the final award in the arbitration case will solve the real problems between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, and fears the case will only escalate tensions.

China certainly does not want to be portrayed as the regional “bully” disrespecting international law. But it is rational for a state to choose the method of problem solving with which it is most comfortable. Compulsory dispute settlement has a role to play in the international system, but there are many other state practices of dispute management including confidence-building, joint development, negotiation, and mediation. The United States in 1986 decided to pull out of the case brought against it by Nicaragua in the International Court of Justice after the court ruled it had jurisdiction. Nonetheless, China’s refusal to participate in the Philippines’ case puts it in a vulnerable situation because it now has no chance to present its legal evidence.

<strong>Land Reclamation</strong>

China’s <a href="http://amti.csis.org/island-tracker/">land reclamation</a> will not strengthen its claims to sovereignty over the features in the South China Sea. It will not enhance China’s maritime claims either. Artificial islands do not generate territorial seas or other maritime zones under UNCLOS because they do not possess the status of islands. Nor does the presence of artificial islands affect delimitation of the territorial sea, the exclusive economic zone, or the continental shelf between states.

Nevertheless, China could be blamed for ignoring its duties under UNCLOS for “due notice,” “appropriate publicity,” and “undertaking environmental impact assessments” related to the creation of artificial islands. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has suggested that China has conducted environmental impact assessments and is continuing to monitor the impact of its reclamation activities. But it seems necessary for China to make these assessments public and acknowledge its duty to cooperate with potentially affected states. China should also give due notice of further construction, maintain a permanent means for giving warning of the presence of artificial islands, and publish appropriate information about their depth, position, and dimensions. While it defends its land reclamation as a means of improving capacity to deliver maritime public goods, China needs to show evidence that it is using its new facilities to maintain maritime safety and security, support search and rescue, and undertake scientific research.

The United States’ concern about military facilities on China’s reclaimed features is understandable. It is rationale for other claimant states to question China’s growing maritime capacity and its potential impact on the status quo in the South China Sea. But China has repeatedly stated that it will stick to the principle of no use or threats of force. As Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during a <a href="http://csis.org/event/statesmens-forum-wang-yi-minister-foreign-affairs-prc">speech at CSIS</a> in late February, “There is no expansionism in China’s genes.” The increasing presence of U.S. warships, and calls for joint patrols with other Australia, Japan, India, and other countries, will only make China feel threatened and trigger fears of containment. That will lead to a further military buildup on its features in the South China Sea for defensive purposes.

<strong>Avoiding Confrontation</strong>

Sino-U.S. differences do exist on these issues. But China and the United States tend to forget their common interests in the South China Sea: the safety and security of sea lanes of communication, and a peaceful and stable political environment. The current cycle of actions and counteractions will lead to nothing but a security dilemma.

In order to resolve this paradox, China and the United States need to engage each other and maintain regular consultations on how they can coexist. Despite the chance of a regional power shift, the United States needs to acknowledge China’s rise and its core interests. Similarly, China must respect the legitimate interests of the United States in the South China Sea, especially freedom of navigation in line with UNCLOS, which is also in China’s interest. Developing better maritime cooperation could work in both nations’ favor.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>China Creates a Second Chance for the ‘Quad’</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Interest in reviving the defunct U.S.-India-Japan-Australia quadrilateral strategic dialogue is mounting. Concerns about provoking China were a principal reason behind the “Quad’s” initial failure. But recent events in the South China Sea have underscored the need for increased coordination.

In May 2007, officials from the foreign ministries of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States met to discuss the creation of a “quadrilateral strategic dialogue,” known as the Quad. Although the four countries held <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/6968412.stm">naval exercises</a> in the Bay of Bengal in September 2007, the initiative quickly withered, largely due to heavy pressure from China. Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/6968412.stm">denied</a> that the Quad had a security component when he met with Chinese premier Hu Jintao at that year’s Group of Eight summit. In early 2008, the new government of Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2008/02/chinese-ghost-story/">definitively</a> <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2008/02/22/commentary/asian-arc-doomed-without-australia/">rejected</a> the proposal amid warming ties with China.

But recent revelations that China has placed <a href="http://amti.csis.org/seeing-the-forest-through-the-sams-on-woody-island/">surface-to-air missiles</a> on a disputed island in the South China Sea and is building a <a href="http://amti.csis.org/another-piece-of-the-puzzle/">radar network</a> that spans the region seem to have revived the Quad as a strategic concept. On March 2, Admiral Harry Harris, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, used the occasion of a <a href="http://www.pacom.mil/Media/SpeechesTestimony/tabid/6706/Article/683842/raisina-dialogue-remarks-lets-be-ambitious-together.aspx">speech</a> in New Delhi to suggest that the U.S-India-Japan trilateral dialogue be expanded to include Australia. All four countries, Harris said, are “united in supporting the international rules-based order.”

Can the Quad overcome the obstacles that doomed it last time? The four countries’ current strategic outlooks suggest that the time is ripe for a revisit. Admiral Harris’s speech indicates that the idea has some currency at high levels of the U.S. government. Building ties with other Pacific democracies could eventually allow the United States to share the burden of regular Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPS) in the South China Sea—to go, as Admiral Harris put it in Delhi, from “exercising together” to “operating together.”

Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, who <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2008/02/chinese-ghost-story/?allpages=yes">originally</a> conceived the idea of the Quad as part of a “concert of Asian Democracies,” is back in power in Tokyo with a strong mandate and firm control over his party. Japan is highly enthusiastic about building its strategic partnership with India, and the Quad would provide a high-profile forum for extending this relationship to Pacific security issues.

Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has announced an <a href="http://amti.csis.org/will-india-truly-start-acting-east-in-andaman-and-nicobar/">Act East</a> policy to increase its presence in the wider Indian Ocean and the western Pacific, has adopted a more <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/12/sino-indian-border-talks-not-enough-to-defuse-tensions/">assertive</a> posture vis-a-vis China, and has increased defense ties with the United States. But India is still hoping to harness its own economy to China’s growth and to receive the $20 billion in investment <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/cheat-sheet/china-promises-20-billion-investment-in-india-a-new-road-to-kailash-mansarovar-667841">promised</a> during President Xi Jinping’s September 2014 visit to India.

Australia, by many accounts the most reluctant member of the group last time around, in February released a new <a href="http://www.defence.gov.au/whitepaper/">defense white paper</a> that foregrounds the importance of its relationship with the United States and says that “Australia’s security and prosperity relies on a stable, rules‐based global order that supports the resolution of disputes through peaceful means, facilitates free and open trade, and enables unfettered access to the global commons.” In September 2015, recently elected prime minister Malcolm Turnbull <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/comment/malcolm-turnbull-outlines-strategy-towards-china-20150924-gjtvts.html">named</a> managing China’s rise as the greatest global security challenge Australia faced.

Admiral Harris’s proposal also comes as the four nations have developed a remarkably similar perspective on the importance of the rule of law in the international system, particularly when it comes to maritime disputes. Australia’s white paper aligns the country’s strategic outlook closely with documents like the U.S.-India <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/25/us-india-joint-strategic-vision-asia-pacific-and-indian-ocean-region">Joint Strategic Vision</a> for the Asia Pacific and Indian Ocean, which enshrines the two nations’ shared commitment to freedom of navigation and the peaceful resolution of disputes. Similarly, Japan’s <a href="http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/siryou/131217anzenhoshou/nss-e.pdf">National Security Strategy</a> describes “the maintenance and protection of international order based on rules and universal values” as part of Japan’s national interest.

Yet one of the main obstacles to forming the Quad in 2007 has actually grown in importance. In the past eight years, China has only become more important to the economies of the four, accounting for more than 20 percent of Australia and Japan’s total trade.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4380" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Graph1.jpg" alt="Graph1" width="479" height="301" />

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4381" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Graph2.jpg" alt="Graph2" width="486" height="306" />

Concerns about Chinese retaliation caused Australia to withdraw from the Quad when its total goods trade with China was less than $44 billion (in today’s U.S. dollars); in 2014 bilateral trade was more than $128 billion. This trend may have peaked, however; Australia’s exports to China reached their height in 2013 and have fallen every year since, including by <a href="http://dfat.gov.au/trade/resources/Documents/chin.pdf">more than 18 percent</a> year-on-year in 2015. The ongoing slowdown in China reduces its influence over trading partners just as its actions in Asia become more aggressive.

The second main obstacle to reviving the Quad is India’s inbuilt suspicion of alliances. Although India embraced the Quad concept in 2007, it has proved reluctant to commit itself to action in the South China Sea. A few days after Admiral Harris’s visit, Indian defense minister Manohar Parrikar gave a press conference in which he <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Parrikar-rules-out-joint-patrolling-with-the-US-in-Asia-Pacific/articleshow/51257493.cms">ruled out</a> the possibility of joint Indo-U.S. naval patrols in the South China Sea, noting that India has never carried out joint operations with another nation.

Reviving the Quad—and risking provoking China—carries serious risks for India. As a prominent Chinese professor of international relations <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/03/world/asia/us-proposes-india-naval-coalition-balance-china-expansion.html">pointed out</a> to the <em>New York Times</em>, China has a variety of levers it can exploit to retaliate against India, including China’s growing economic and security relationship with Pakistan. Furthermore, the principle of maritime law that undergirds the most recent <a href="http://amti.csis.org/south-china-sea-fonop-2-0-a-step-in-the-right-direction/">U.S. FONOP</a>—the right of naval ships to transit in peaceful passage through another country’s exclusive economic zone without prior notification—is not a principle that India is <a href="http://nbr.org/publications/asia_policy/Free/AP21/AsiaPolicy21_SouthChinaSeaRT_January2016.pdf">comfortable</a> fully endorsing. If consistently applied, it could someday allow Chinese warships to transit regularly between existing or planned Chinese-built ports in <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/myanmar-citic-project-idUSL3N14K1D720151231">western Myanmar</a>, <a href="http://atimes.com/2015/12/suspended-chinese-funded-colombo-port-city-project-gets-new-lease-of-life/">Sri Lanka</a>, and <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2015/11/chinese-state-firm-takes-control-of-strategically-vital-gwadar-port/">southwestern Pakistan</a>—a route that would parallel India’s west coast. Signing on to the U.S. agenda in the South China Sea would make it <a href="http://www.orfonline.org/research/india-and-the-south-china-sea-dispute/">more difficult</a> for India to protest such activities in future.

These issues don’t doom the Quad—after all, India was willing to consider the proposal under the previous government, which was both more cautious and more suspicious of the U.S. than India’s present leadership. But they do counsel patience and a willingness to be open-minded about what the goals of the dialogue would be. The four countries should focus first on regular, low-profile communication as a group—working to achieve a true dialogue, one that addresses economic issues alongside strategic ones. Regular meetings could lead to more explicit cooperation, such as pooling capabilities for <a href="https://twitter.com/orfonline/status/704965211929751552">maritime domain awareness</a>, and would build trust between the participants. Will Australia, India, Japan and the United States truly move from exercising together to operating together? In the end, it will probably be China’s actions that determine where the Quad goes next.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Philippines and Japan Sign New Defense Agreement</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Philippine defense secretary Voltaire Gazmin and Japanese ambassador to the Philippines Kazuhide Ishikawa on February 29 signed a new defense agreement to allow the transfer of defense equipment and technology from Japan to the Philippines. It also provides for the Philippines and Japan to conduct joint research and development, and even joint production, of defense equipment and technology. The agreement stipulates the formation of a Philippine-Japan joint committee that will manage the transfer of defense equipment and technology, as well as how the materiel and know-how can be used. Both parties expect that the agreement will not only enhance their evolving security partnership but also help Japan further develop the production and technological bases for its growing defense industry.

Japan has similar defense agreements with the United States and Australia. This pact, however, is its first with a fellow East Asian country—and one that, like Japan, is embroiled in a territorial dispute with China. The negotiations leading to the agreement were first disclosed to the public when President Benigno Aquino and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met on November 17, 2015, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders’ meeting in Manila. Both concurred that the agreement would not include specifics about the type of security assistance to be offered.

Upon signing the agreement, Secretary Gazmin did not mention any specific defense equipment to be transferred by Japan, but he did say that the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) needs to upgrade its intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. The <em>Asahi Shimbun </em>revealed that Japan plans to provide the Philippines with five second-hand Beechcraft TC-90 King Air reconnaissance planes currently used by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) for training, which can be equipped with basic surface and air-surveillance radar.   These short-range reconnaissance aircraft will enable the Philippine Navy to patrol the disputed waters of the South China Sea. The Philippines has also expressed interest in the purchase of other Japanese-made defense equipment. Early last year, Philippine defense officials raised the prospect of acquiring surplus P-3C Orion long-range reconnaissance planes and even submarines from Japan. An anonymous Philippine defense official <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/3a249732c2fd42ed85a415b8021a8dcf/japan-supply-philippines-military-equipment">recently said</a> that this new security accord, “opens the door to a lot of opportunities beyond the confines of mere equipment transfer or sale.”

<strong>Sense of Urgency</strong>

It is interesting that the agreement took only three months to negotiate. This reflected a sense of urgency by both parties to have the new pact signed to pave the way for Japan to donate used military equipment, transfer technology, and extend security training to the AFP. The Aquino administration in 2011 decided to build up the AFP’s capabilities to accomplish a very modest goal—the development of a competent force capable of defending the Philippines’ interests and the land features it occupies in the South China Sea. This will require the AFP to acquire the following capabilities:
<ol>
	<li>Effective forces in the South China Sea and nearby coastal areas with the competence to defend Philippine territory; and</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
	<li>Greater surveillance and monitoring to secure Philippine islands and prevent unoccupied islands/reefs from being occupied by other claimants.</li>
</ol>
Despite these unambitious objectives, the Aquino administration is still immobilized by scant financial resources. Consequently, the Philippines has turned to both the United States and Japan as it modernizes its ill-equipped navy and air force.

Japan, meanwhile, is alarmed by the long-term implications of China’s island-building activities in the South China Sea. In late 2015, Tokyo considered expanding JMSDF surveillance operations in the South China Sea. During the APEC leaders’ meeting in November, Prime Minister Abe announced that Japan was considering joining the United States and possibly other partners in joint patrols in disputed waters of the South China Sea, though domestic opposition seems to have forced him to back away from that. Japan has since announced that forces returning from anti-piracy missions in the Gulf of Aden would engage in surveillance patrols while passing through the South China Sea.  Meanwhile Tokyo has continued to explore ways to expand its security cooperation with other Asian countries as an alternative to more direct action by Japanese forces.

<strong>Enhancing the Strategic Partnership</strong>

Secretary Gazmin insisted that the new agreement between Japan and the Philippines is not directed against any country and aims only to address strategic gaps in the underfunded AFP. But the agreement is a clear indication of the increasing level of security cooperation between Manila and Tokyo in the face of China’s expansive claims and the build-up of its naval and paramilitary capabilities.

The historic change in the direction of Philippines-Japan security relations became apparent when the two countries’ signed the 2012 Statement of Intent on Defense Cooperation Exchanges, held joint naval search and rescue drills in the South China Sea in mid-2015, and began exploring the prospect of a status of forces agreement that would allow Japanese forces to conduct larger military exercises with the AFP in the Philippines. Two days after Secretary Gazmin and Ambassador Ishikawa signed the new defense agreement, two JMSDF ships—the <em>Uraga </em>and<em> Takashina</em>—docked in Manila Bay for a three-day goodwill visit to the Philippines.   The <em>Asahi Shimbun </em><a href="http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/politics/AJ201603030056">recently reported</a> that in early April two JMFDF destroyers and a Japanese submarine—the first to visit the Philippines in 15 years—will make a port call at Subic Bay.

The signing of the agreement on the transfer of defense equipment and technology between the Philippines and Japan and the increasing frequency of JMSDF ship visits are signs that Japan is determined to cooperate more closely with Southeast Asian states on maritime security in order to balance China’s efforts to enforce its expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Will Indonesia, Provoked, Now Choose to Lead on the South China Sea?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A confrontation between Indonesian and Chinese law enforcement vessels in the South China Sea over the weekend could mark a turning point in Indonesian foreign policy under President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, forcing him to choose between two of his top priorities: attracting foreign investment – particularly Chinese investment – to fund his ambitious infrastructure agenda; and a more assertive defense of Indonesian territorial integrity and sovereignty over its natural resources. That, in turn, could herald a significant shift in diplomacy over the South China Sea.

Indonesia has long sought to avoid the appearance of alignment in contests between great powers – a delicate act that Indonesia’s first vice president described as “rowing between two reefs.” In the case of China’s extensive and ambiguous maritime claims in the South China Sea, which the United States has protested lack a basis in international law, Indonesia has historically sought to remain above the fray and serve as an “honest broker” between claimants.

But the <a href="https://next.ft.com/content/4b36eda4-ef3d-11e5-9f20-c3a047354386">Chinese Coast Guard’s recent actions</a> may have just rendered that approach untenable, by demonstrating in particularly dramatic fashion what Indonesian officials have always feared: that China’s claims also directly infringe on Indonesia’s own interests.

On March 20, an Indonesian fisheries law enforcement vessel attempted to seize a Chinese trawler that it had found fishing in Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) near the Natuna Islands, at the southern tip of the South China Sea. Chinese officials did not deny the report, but described the area as “traditional Chinese fishing grounds.”

As the Indonesian authorities towed the boat back to port, a Chinese Coast Guard ship appeared. According to Indonesian fisheries minister Susi Pudjiastuti, the coast guard ship rammed the fishing boat under tow, forcing Indonesian officers to release it. The boat’s eight crew remain under arrest in Indonesia.

China does not claim the Natuna Islands, but there is an overlap between China’s nine-dash line – which outlines an ambiguous claim to much of the South China Sea – and Indonesia’s internationally recognized exclusive economic zone, which extends outward from the islands. As China has become more active in asserting rights within the nine-dash line, Chinese law enforcements vessels <a href="http://www.aspistrategist.org.au/mapping-the-nine-dash-line-recent-incidents-involving-indonesia-in-the-south-china-sea/">have occasionally harassed their Indonesian counterparts</a> as they have sought to protect Indonesian fisheries from unlicensed Chinese trawlers.

In 2010, noting the overlap, Indonesia sought a diplomatic remedy by requesting that China clarify the nature of its claims inside the nine-dash line. The question, of course, concerns not just the rights to obscure fisheries, but the character of Chinese power in Southeast Asia. Will Beijing abide by international law, or will it seek to impose its will on its neighbors through displays of force? An answer from Beijing has not been forthcoming.

While the foreign ministry has been content to wait for a response from Beijing, others in the Indonesian government have not been so patient. Under Jokowi, they have been led by the maverick fisheries minister, Susi Pudjiastuti. The <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indonesiarealtime/2015/02/03/susi-earns-highest-approval-rating-among-indonesian-ministers/">most popular minister</a> in the Indonesian cabinet, Susi rose to prominence last year by blowing up impounded foreign boats that her ministry’s patrols had caught fishing without a license in Indonesian waters. Many Indonesians, outraged by reports of foreign theft of a critical natural resource, hailed Susi’s hardline approach as an appropriate deterrent. Meanwhile, the Indonesian military modernized and reinforced its facilities in the Natunas.

But Susi was restrained by her cabinet colleagues in what she could do to Chinese fishing boats that Indonesia had captured and impounded. One was quietly scuttled, but her colleagues prevented her from blowing it up for the cameras, fearing a backlash from Beijing.

Sensing her opportunity following the confrontation on March 20, she quickly called a press conference and denounced China’s “arrogant” behavior, promising to summon the Chinese ambassador – a privilege normally reserved for the foreign ministry – and later saying that Indonesia would consider taking China to court over the issue. Not to be outdone, Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi summoned China’s chargé d’affaires in Jakarta the next day, telling him that she felt the ministry’s efforts at diplomacy had been “sabotaged” by the incident.

The confrontation comes at a pivotal time, as the Coordinating Ministry for Politics, Law, and Security conducts an inter-agency review of Indonesia’s South China Sea policy, the first since China’s new assertiveness in the sea became apparent, which is designed to settle differences on the subject within the Jokowi administration. Unless a face-saving arrangement between Beijing and Jakarta is reached soon, the March 20 incident will push the review to take a harder line, despite the risk that would present to Jokowi’s ambitions for Chinese investment in Indonesia, and the appearance it would leave that Indonesia was aligning more closely with the United States.

Indonesia’s size — it is the fourth most populous country in the world — has historically offered it a leadership role in Southeast Asian diplomacy, though one which Jokowi has often appeared reluctant to take up. Nevertheless, Indonesia’s smaller neighbors still look to it for support and guidance. If this week’s events lead to a shift in the Indonesian position on the South China Sea, they will take note.

But if Indonesia does adopt a hard line toward China, of equal importance will be whether it does so only in the service of protecting its own narrow interests – for example by seeking assurances from China regarding only its own economic prerogatives – or if it does so in defense of the international norms and principles that protect the maritime interests of all countries, including Indonesia’s smaller neighbors.

A <a href="http://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/sovereignty-and-sea-president-joko-widodos-foreign-policy-challenges">careful examination of Jokowi’s foreign policy instincts</a> suggests that the former course of action may prove attractive to him, as it would allow Indonesia to maintain its distance between the two great powers and continue to attract Chinese investment unimpeded. But what guarantee would Jokowi have that Beijing would continue to honor its assurances? Greater Indonesian leadership in the region, though it may initially seem more difficult, would look forward to a future in which Chinese power was constrained by Beijing’s support for international norms and institutions, and would therefore better protect Indonesian interests in the long-term.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Will Others Respect Precedent Set in the Philippines’ Case?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On March 1, Representative Joe Courtney <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-resolution/631">introduced a resolution</a> in the U.S. House of Representatives calling upon the U.S. Senate to ratify the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The resolution affirms that it is in the U.S. national interest to become a party to the convention. It recommends the ratification of UNCLOS remain a top administration priority because the treaty has received bipartisan support from every president since 1994, and its importance has been underscored by the strategic challenges the United States faces in the Asia-Pacific region, especially in the South China Sea.

Meanwhile the United States remains bound by the customary international law underpinning UNCLOS, including Article 121 of the treaty regarding the status and entitlements of islands. And along with Australia, the European Union, and others, the United States is urging China to respect the forthcoming ruling by the tribunal established under the rules of UNCLOS to decide Manila’s case against Beijing’s South China Sea claims—a ruling that is expected to be favorable for the Philippines. At a press conference following the U.S.-ASEAN Summit held last month in Sunnylands, California, President Barack Obama said that the parties to UNCLOS are obligated to respect and abide by the ruling.

But that ruling could set a precedent affecting the claims of several of the nations that are calling on China to abide by it. For instance, Australia, Brazil, France, Japan, and the United States all make expansive maritime claims from remote islets that are not dissimilar in size or habitability to some of the Spratly Islands that the Philippines insists are legally rocks, not islands. If the tribunal rules that those features in the South China Sea are indeed rocks and therefore cannot generate a 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) or continental shelf in accordance with Article 121 of UNCLOS, all states should face pressure to abide by the precedent set. That means that McDonald Island (Australia), Clipperton Island (France), Saint Peter and Paul Rocks (Brazil), Okinotorishima (Japan), and Howland Island, Baker Island, and Kingman Reef (the United States) should generate only 12-nautical-mile territorial seas, not EEZs or continental shelves as their owners currently claim.

If the tribunal decides that the land features in question in the Spratlys, particularly <a href="http://amti.csis.org/exploring-itu-aba-virtual-tour-south-china-sea-islet/">Itu Aba (Taiping Island)</a>, are “rocks” under Article 121(3) of UNCLOS, should the United States take the award into account and bring its own maritime claims into conformity with the ruling? Howland Island, Baker Island, and Kingman Reef in the Pacific Ocean constitute part of the United States Minor Outlying Islands. They contain no fresh water, no agricultural soil, and no permanent population. They measure 0.69 square miles, 0.46 square miles, and 0.004 square miles, respectively. In other words, they are clearly less able than Itu Aba to “sustain human habitation” or “economic life” as required of an island under Article 121(3).

The U.S. government has not made public its position on Article 121(3) and maritime zones generated by uninhabited islands, but its leading decisionmakers on topics related to the law of the sea have consistently asserted that the United States is entitled to claim an EEZ around all its possessions, whether inhabited or not, without regard to size or location.

At the 1986 annual meeting of the Law of the Sea Institute in Miami, Florida, the State Department’s assistant legal adviser for oceans, international environmental, and scientific affairs David Colson said, “The United States had concluded that all islands should have the same capacity to generate EEZs, whether they are inhabited or not, and that isolated or awkwardly located islands should not be viewed as ‘special circumstances’ or geographical anomalies in determining extended maritime boundaries.” He also said, "We decided that any piece of real estate could fit under the definition of an island, and we made the decision based upon what areas had United States territorial seas drawn around them."

Professor Jon Van Dyke interpreted this U.S. position as meaning "any insular feature that can generate a territorial sea can also generate an EEZ. Under this view, there are no ‘rocks’ that meet the criteria of article 121(3) of being unable to ‘sustain human habitation or economic life of their own.’” The effect of this U.S. position “is to expand the areas of the ocean where the living and nonliving resources can be claimed by one nation to the exclusion of all others, thus reducing the resources that remain to be shared as the ‘common heritage’ for all humankind,” according to Van Dyke.

If this is indeed the official U.S. position, and if the tribunal decides in Manila’s favor regarding the legal status of features in the Spratlys, then in order to respect that precedent the U.S. government will need to consider changing or abandoning its claim to 200 EEZs and continental shelves from its remote Pacific islands. It should be hoped that other states, including Australia and Japan, also take the tribunal’s decisions into account and bring their maritime claims and conduct into conformity with UNCLOS if necessary.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Developing a Scarborough Contingency Plan</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[U.S. chief of naval operations Admiral John Richardson <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-china-scarborough-exclu-idUKKCN0WK01B">told Reuters</a> on March 19 that the United States was monitoring increased Chinese activity around Scarborough Shoal. He warned, “I think we see some surface ship activity … survey type of activity … That’s an area of concern ... a next possible area of reclamation.”

Satellite imagery from March 24 shows no Chinese dredging or construction activity at Scarborough Shoal. The only vessels present were a Chinese civilian ship anchored within the mouth of the lagoon, which has been typical for several years, and two Filipino trimaran-type fishing ships outside the shoal. But that does not mean that Chinese ships have not performed surveys in preparation for reclamation, as Admiral Richardson suggested.

<strong>Why Scarborough Shoal?</strong>

Given that Beijing is expected to lose at least <a href="http://amti.csis.org/a-case-of-rocks-islands/">part of the case</a> that Manila has brought against it in the Permanent Court of Arbitration, China might take action to demonstrate that it will not be constrained by the court’s decision. Potential escalations include re-imposing a blockade of Filipino troops stationed at Second Thomas Shoal, deploying military assets to the Spratly Islands, or announcing an air defense identification zone over the South China Sea—but undertaking reclamation work at Scarborough Shoal would be particularly concerning.

[Best_Wordpress_Gallery id="41" gal_title="scarboroughSlides"]

Scarborough Shoal lies about 120 nautical miles from the main Philippine island of Luzon and 185 nautical miles from Manila. It is situated in an otherwise empty area of the South China Sea more than 250 nautical miles from each of the region’s two disputed island groups, the Paracels to the northwest and the Spratlys to the southwest. Were China to undertake reclamation at Scarborough, it would allow the Chinese military to maintain a presence throughout the South China Sea and even extend its reach over parts of the Philippine home islands. That would have enormous strategic implications for both the Philippines and the United States, which just negotiated U.S. access to five Philippine bases under the <a href="http://amti.csis.org/edca-refocus-eyes-on-the-afps-modernization-program/">Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement</a>.

<strong>Concerning Consequences</strong>

Chinese land reclamation at Scarborough Shoal would present the Philippines and the United States with multiple challenges. From a security perspective, it would undermine perceptions of U.S. willingness to uphold regional security. This is particularly true because the Philippines lost access to Scarborough in 2012 after a failed U.S. effort to negotiate a mutual Chinese and Philippine withdrawal. An airfield or port at Scarborough would strengthen Chinese military capabilities in and around the South China Sea, as well as complicate U.S., ally, and partner planning for a crisis.

Reclamation at Scarborough would also carry enormous ecological costs. The arbitral tribunal will likely declare that the environmental devastation China caused with its reclamation in the Spratlys violated international law. Undertaking new reclamation at Scarborough would be another sign that Beijing is thumbing its nose at the court and the existing rules-based order more broadly.

From a diplomatic perspective, Scarborough reclamation might also be the final nail in the coffin for ASEAN’s stuttering efforts to diplomatically manage regional tensions. In the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, the ASEAN states and China explicitly agreed to refrain from only one thing: “inhabiting on the presently uninhabited islands, reefs, shoals, cays, and other features.” Reclamation at Scarborough would violate that cardinal rule; it would be a signal to the region that Beijing’s negotiations with ASEAN were a smokescreen—one which it no longer needs.

<strong>Crafting an Effective Response</strong>

Although Washington and Manila face constraints in responding to this type of “grey zone” tactic—in which China seeks to change the status quo without overt use of force, often employing civilian or paramilitary vessels—a coordinated three-part strategy could potentially deter reclamation. The security, environmental, and diplomatic costs of reclamation at Scarborough necessitate such a response.

The first step in countering Chinese reclamation is to ensure that Washington and Manila are sharing intelligence on potential Chinese actions. China’s preference has been to take advantage of regional states’ poor maritime domain awareness capabilities by presenting them with faits accomplis. Admiral Richardson’s statement to Reuters indicates that the United States is keeping a close eye on Scarborough Shoal, but statements from Philippine officials suggest they might not be briefed on U.S. intelligence. Both sides must not only collect intelligence, but share that information in order to response appropriately at the first sign of imminent reclamation.

The second key to a successful deterrence posture needs to be clearly communicated beforehand: the United States should state publicly that it will consider itself bound to intervene if Philippine troops or ships are attacked at Scarborough Shoal or other areas of the South China Sea. Article V of the U.S.-Philippines defense treaty commits the United States to respond to any attack on Philippine “armed forces, public vessels or aircraft in the Pacific.” That means the United States can, and should, remain neutral on the legitimacy of Manila’s territorial claims while still clarifying that any unprovoked attack on Philippine forces in disputed waters or territory would fall within the scope of the treaty commitment.

Filipinos have been looking for that kind of explicit commitment from Washington for several years, and the U.S. government’s refusal to give it has created an undercurrent of skepticism in the Philippines about just how “<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-usa-obama-idUSBREA3S02T20140429">ironclad</a>” the American commitment really is. When he visits Manila in April, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter will have an opportunity to put those fears to rest. Doing so, and being willing to follow through if that commitment is challenged, is key to bolstering Philippine resolve to confront China in grey zone incidents, and to deterring China from escalating incidents into open conflict.

The final and most difficult step to blocking Chinese reclamation at Scarborough Shoal will be having Philippine assets prepared to intervene at short notice. Despite the severe gaps in its naval and coast guard capabilities, the Philippines, not the United States, must take the lead in confronting Chinese activities at Scarborough. The shoal includes several rocks that entitle it to a territorial sea. Sending a U.S. naval vessel into the territorial sea of a disputed feature in the absence of any use of force by China would violate (or at least seriously muddy) the very international laws and norms that the United States is looking to uphold. Even if successful in blocking Chinese reclamation, such a U.S. operation would be a Pyrrhic victory.

Instead, the best chance to stop land reclamation at Scarborough Shoal would be through the use of Philippine assets, with the United States just outside the territorial sea. The Philippines should be prepared to send assets—likely several smaller coast guard vessels and at least one of the <em>Hamilton-</em>class cutters its navy received from the United States—to prevent Chinese reclamation at the shoal. Doing so would not require overt aggression from the Philippine ships—blocking the entrance to the shoal or maneuvering to interfere with the operation of dredging ships could make a reclamation operation prohibitively difficult. In the meantime, U.S. Navy assets would need to remain in position over the horizon to signal that they would be prepared to intervene should China attack Philippine forces.

Despite its bullying and coercion, Beijing has been hesitant to risk a military clash, especially with the United States, but also with its neighbors. The key to a successful response, as shown by Vietnam during the Haiyang Shiyou 981 standoff or the Philippines when it ran a Chinese blockade of Second Thomas Shoal in early 2014, has been to force Beijing to choose between achieving its aims with force or backing off and trying again another day.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

Over the past few years, the Philippines has emerged as China’s most intransigent neighbor. In less than a decade, Filipino-Chinese relations went from a “<a href="https://www.rsis.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2000/01/Monograph22.pdf">golden age</a>” to arguably <a href="http://www.policyforum.net/a-toxic-relationship/">Asia’s most toxic</a> bilateral relationship. China has repeatedly characterized the Philippines as a “<a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/126178/ph-slams-china-over-troublemaker-remark">trouble maker</a>,” while Filipino officials, like their counterparts in Washington, often equate China’s actions in disputed waters with “<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/10/obama-says-china-bullying-smaller-nations-in-south-china-sea-row">bullying</a>.”

Most crucially, the Philippines is also the only country, so far, to have taken China <a href="http://amti.csis.org/arbitration-101-philippines-v-china/">to international court</a> over the South China Sea disputes. To China’s consternation, the Philippines, under the <a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/134880/supreme-court-upholds-legality-of-edca">newly-approved</a> Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), has also <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-set-to-deploy-troops-to-philippines-in-rebalancing-act-1458466797">granted greater basing access</a> to U.S. forces, including facilities close to contested waters.

As the Philippines inches closer to electing a new leader, however, there is growing <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/new-twist-the-south-china-sea-showdown-12638">speculation</a> that the country may take a radically different approach under President Benigno Aquino’s successor. Much will depend on who is elected the next Filipino president in May. But given the explosion in anti-China sentiment and attention to the South China Sea issue within the Philippines, as well as the negative legacy of the administration of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (2001-2010)—which was accused of having cut a corrupt deal with Beijing regarding the South China Sea—the next Filipino president will have limited room for any major foreign policy recalibration unless China offers tangible concessions and regains the good will of its estranged neighbor.

<strong>A Toxic Relationship</strong>

Bilateral relations actually did experience a short-lived “golden age” under the Arroyo administration, which negotiated a Joint Maritime Seismic Undertaking (JMSU) to explore for hydrocarbons in the South China Sea with Beijing and Hanoi. The Arroyo government, which adopted an equal balancing strategy toward all great powers, also welcomed massive Chinese infrastructure investment. But most of those landmark agreements resulted in <a href="http://nghiencuubiendong.vn/en/wikileaks/683-us-ambassy-in-manila-controversy-over-spratly-islands-territorial">corruption scandals</a> and constitutional anomalies.

The Aquino administration, which ran on an anti-corruption platform, was naturally more circumspect in dealing with China. Yet, during his first two years in office, Aquino <a href="http://fpif.org/the_china-philippines-us_triangle/">made various efforts</a> to reach out to Beijing, ranging from his controversial decision to skip the Nobel Prize ceremony for Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo to his high-profile state visit to Beijing in 2011.

It was China’s rising territorial assertiveness, culminating in the seizure of Scarborough Shoal in mid-2012, which torpedoed bilateral relations. Still, Aquino planned to open communication channels with the newly-installed Xi Jinping administration on the sidelines of the 2013 China-ASEAN Expo in Nanning, only to be brusquely “<a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1300512/china-snubs-philippine-president-over-planned-visit-nanning-expo?page=all">disinvited</a>” by the host country. Since then, relations have gone steadily downhill. In its final years in office, the Aquino administration largely eschewed engagement in favor of a more confrontational approach to Beijing, which has progressively tightened the noose around Filipino troops and fishermen traversing the South China Sea.

The current Philippine government sees <a href="http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/470366/news/nation/dfa-chief-phl-ran-into-dead-end-when-it-tried-to-resolve-sea-disputes-with-china">no purpose in dialogue</a> with China given Beijing’s commitment to pursue assert its “indisputable” sovereignty throughout the South China Sea. As a result, Presidents Xi and Aquino have not held a single formal summit, and in recent years the two countries have not agreed to any bilateral confidence-building measures or established hotlines between relevant agencies to manage incidents in contested waters. Meanwhile economic relations, particularly in terms of Chinese investment, have <a href="http://amti.csis.org/the-diplomatic-implications-of-philippines-china-arbitration/">suffered dramatically</a>.

<strong>The Successor  </strong>

<strong> </strong>A <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-javad-heydarian/fiesta-democracy-risks-an_b_9455538.html">cursory look</a> at the presidential race suggests that it is too early to predict who will be the next president of the Philippines. The top four contenders—Senator Grace Poe, Vice President Jejomar Binay, Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, and Interior Secretary Mar Roxas—have been in a statistical dead heat according to polls. As a result, whoever does win the presidency is expected to do so with only a plurality of votes, though the <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/777300/poe-keeps-lead-in-latest-pulse-asia-poll">latest surveys</a> and <a href="http://www.mb.com.ph/erap-endorses-poe-bongbong/">developments</a> suggest that Poe could pull away in the coming weeks.

For the first time in recent memory, foreign policy has become a key election issue. All the top candidates have <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/south-china-sea-dispute-looms-over-philippine-elections-1457843644">confined their positions</a> to vague, if generally nationalistic, statements without giving specifics. But based on their rhetoric and track records, it is unlikely that any of them, if elected, would adopt the same kind of incendiary language toward China as Aquino.

Binay has gone so far as to <a href="http://www.mb.com.ph/joint-exploration-in-south-china-sea-proposed/">propose</a> a joint development scheme with China in order to resolve the South China Sea disputes. But in light of the controversy over the <a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/05/30/1329017/sc-asked-rule-legality-jmsu">legality of the Arroyo administration’s JMSU</a>, and ongoing <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/125289-vp-binay-liable-graft-corruption-coa">corruption investigations</a> against the Binay, his family members, and close associates, his proposal has been met with heavy criticism and deep suspicion.

Duterte has offered a <a href="http://www.philstar.com/news-videos/2016/02/10/1551677/duterte-open-bilateral-talks-joint-exploration-resolving-sea-dispute">similar proposal</a>—though saying that China would first have to accept Philippines claims—and declared his openness to direct dialogue with the Chinese leadership. Given his corruption-free and strongman image, he was not met with the same barrage of criticism as Binay. As pragmatists, Binay and Duterte have both consistently reiterated the significance of having robust economic relations with China. But tough-talking Duterte, who <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/125304-duterte-laylo-poll-february-march-small-winner">seems to have</a> developed political <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Antifragile-Things-that-Gain-Disorder/dp/0141038225">anti-fragility</a>, seems less vulnerable to accusations of corruption, being pro-China, or becoming an “Arroyo 2.0.”

Roxas and Poe, so far, have promised more continuity than departure from Aquino’s policies, though both have displayed their willingness to re-open high-level communication channels with China. In fact, Roxas was the last high-level Philippine official to have <a href="http://president.gov.ph/news/palace-reports-meeting-between-dilg-secretary-mar-roxas-and-chinese-vice-president-xi-jinping-underscored-importance-of-bilateral-relations-of-two-countries/">a direct meeting</a> with Xi Jinping. With the <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/712882/buying-f-16-fighter-jets-a-mistake-says-duterte">exception of Duterte</a>, the candidates have all largely supported <a href="http://amti.csis.org/catch-up-in-manila-for-minimum-deterrence/">ongoing efforts</a> to enhance the Philippines’ military strength to achieve a minimum deterrence capability vis-à-vis China.

<a href="http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/126108-five-candidates-one-policy-platform">As for the EDCA</a>, Binay and Duterte seem to be open to it, though Duterte has repeatedly expressed his frustrations with what he sees as a lack of American support in the South China Sea. Poe has opposed the agreement on procedural grounds, arguing that it needs ratification by the Philippine Senate. Roxas has been silent on the issue, but he is expected to continue Aquino’s efforts to upgrade Philippine security ties with major allies, particularly the United States and <a href="http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2016/03/05/turning-over-a-new-leaf-in-japan-philippines-relations/">Japan</a>.

Anti-China sentiment is <a href="https://www.sws.org.ph/pr20150709b.htm">at historic-high</a>s among the Filipino public, which is carefully following the South China Sea disputes and is <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/96873-filipinos-government-south-china-sea-sws">largely supportive</a> of efforts to resist China’s maritime ambitions. This creates structural constraints on the ability of any president to radically reconfigure Philippine-China relations. But the next president will have some leverage in dealing with Beijing. He or she could renegotiate the parameters of the EDCA, which as an executive agreement is within the president’s purview, and also leverage the likely-favorable outcome of the Philippines’ arbitration case against China. But in the absence of any corresponding concessions from Beijing, the next Philippine president will not be able to depart from the status quo without risking political backlash at home.

Nonetheless, there is room for negotiation and confidence-building measures. China could end its siege of the Filipino detachment at Second Thomas Shoal; agree to a mutual disengagement from Scarborough Shoal; refrain from imposing an air defense identification or exclusion-zone in the Spratlys. In exchange, the Philippines could promise not to use the arbitration outcome as a propaganda tool against China.

Ultimately, the two sides could explore joint development and exploration schemes in contested waters. But that would require constitutional amendment in the Philippines, for which the next president will need a strong political mandate and a squeaky-clean image in order to maintain public support and be an effective advocate.

No matter who is elected, the road to improved bilateral relations will be bumpy and uncertain.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Flexible Response to Deter in the South China Sea</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[China's growing assertiveness regarding maritime disputes in the South China Sea is not the result of a burst of nationalism or any short-term calculation. In fact, China has consistently pursued a single long-term strategy with the effective control of the entire South China Sea as its ultimate goal.

This strategy has five core features. First and foremost, it seeks to change the territorial status quo gradually, island-by-island. This stands in contrast to a strategy whereby a country tries to gobble up the entire disputed territory in one fell swoop. China first occupied the Paracel Islands in 1974 and then slowly expanded its presence southward by attacking Vietnam's islands in the Spratly chain in the 1980s. Most recently, after a tense standoff with the Philippines, China took effective control of the Scarborough Shoal, thereby changing the territorial status quo further in its favor. China pursues this course of action in order to gain incremental advantage in the dispute while avoid upsetting the other disputants too much, thereby preventing a unified and effective response from other countries.

Second, it is founded on full-spectrum diplomacy, meaning the skillful use of every instrument of statecraft available, from military coercion and geo-economics intimidation to economic rewards and high-profile negotiations. Nowhere was this clearer than during the Haiyang Shiyou 981 oilrig crisis. China precipitated the crisis by dispatching the massive oilrig to waters claimed by Vietnam as part of its exclusive economic zone. It then maintained pressure on Vietnam by deploying a combination of coast guard ships and warships. After having denied many Vietnamese requests to deescalate the conflict, Beijing sent State Councilor Yang Jiechi to smooth out differences with Hanoi.

Second, China’s strategy relies on low-intensity but constant and simultaneous small provocations at multiple pressure points, which serve to stretch thin the capabilities of others to respond while limiting the risk of escalation to a manageable level. This prevents a resolute and unified response from China's smaller neighbors because they are led to think that the benefits of resisting China during any given provocation are smaller than the costs of disrupting the overall relationship with Beijing. Thus major crises like the oil rig deployment are rare. Instead China has focused mainly on land reclamation activities and the incremental militarization of it artificial islands.

Third, China emphasizes the "bilateral" nature of disputes to avoid intervention by external powers such as the United States and Japan on the side of weaker claimants. Since China is much more powerful than each of its neighbors, bilateral negotiations give China the most leverage. Furthermore, by reducing the number of players involved in the dispute, China minimizes uncertainty in its planning and gains the confidence to behave more assertively.

Lastly, the Chinese strategy is heavily dependent on the non-lethal use of military coercion, which aims to create and fortify "situations of strength" rather than provoke a full-blown armed conflict. Future actions in this category would include declaring an air defense identification zone or deploying surface to air missiles in the Spratly Islands.

This strategy, known as <a href="http://warontherocks.com/2014/02/america-has-no-answer-to-chinas-salami-slicing/">salami-slicing</a>, involves the slow accumulation of small changes, none of which in isolation amounts to a <em>casus belli</em>, but which add up over time to a substantial change in the strategic picture. The strategy’s purpose is not open confrontation but the creation of faits accomplis, which has limited the possible responses from ASEAN claimants and the international community, including the United States.

Current measures cannot effectively deter Chinese expansion in the South China Sea because they mostly take place at the macro-level and do not aim to directly change the status quo, whereas Chinese activities in disputed waters are mostly micro-level and have direct effects on the ground. The U.S. nuclear umbrella and web of military alliances can effectively deter a Chinese attack on another country but cannot not credibly deter low-intensity activities that do not involve a direct use of military force.

To counter China’s “salami-slicing,” a strategy of flexible response is needed—one that imposes immediate and proportionate costs on every Chinese escalatory action. Such a response should have four core features: it should be discrete, targeted, proportionate, and immediate.

The U.S. retaliatory response to a Chinese action should be <em>discrete</em>, meaning a single, independent action that can be unilaterally or multilaterally carried out at will. A clear example was the sending of two B-52s to contest China’s announcement of an air defense identification zone over the East China Sea in 2013.

It should be <em>targeted</em> instead of indiscriminate. This is important because it limits the risk of large-scale Chinese retaliations. At the same time, ensuring that U.S. actions are only aimed at those actively and directly engaged seeking to change the status quo in the South China Sea bolsters the legitimacy of the U.S. response. For instance, instead of imposing sweeping economic sanctions on China, the United States should respond to China's land reclamation by sanctioning companies involved in the process, such as the <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-right-way-sanction-china-15285">China Communications Construction Company Dredging</a> firm.

The response should also be <em>proportionate</em>, in that its intensity should roughly match that of the Chinese act. This limits the risk of escalatory response while allowing the costs that China would have to suffer to vary according to its own actions.

And lastly, U.S response should be carried out <em>immediately</em> after a Chinese escalatory action to show that there is a cost to every misbehavior, as well as to negate any potential benefits that China could reap from its action. For instance, if China deploys surface to air missiles on its features in the Spratlys, the United States should help Vietnam and the Philippines acquire assets specifically designed to counteract those Chinese capabilities.

To stop China from continuing to change the status quo in the South China Sea and militarize the dispute, the United States must be able to deter effectively. And ultimately, the greatest value of flexible response lies in its ability to send an unambiguous deterrence signal to China. As long as U.S. responses rely on actions with a primary purpose other than deterrence, such as joint exercises and freedom of navigation operations, it is not able to send a message of resolve to China because it suggests Washington is not ready to bear the costs of directly confronting China’s actions.

A flexible response strategy would show China that there is a cost to deconstructive actions. It would also demonstrate that the United States has both the will to challenge China and a specific plan to counteract every Chinese measure. And it would strongly reassures allies and partners in Asia that Washington will match words with deeds.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On <a href="http://nation.lk/online/2016/03/19/thought-for-food-2.html">March 19</a>, after more than a year in limbo, the Sri Lankan government announced it had officially given the go-ahead to resume work on Colombo Port City (CPC). A massive $1.4 billion, <a href="http://atimes.com/2015/12/suspended-chinese-funded-colombo-port-city-project-gets-new-lease-of-life/">575 acre</a> project that combines port facilities with residential and commercial development, CPC is being built as a joint venture between the Sri Lankan government and China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC), a Chinese <a href="https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-assigns-first-time-A3-rating-to-China-Communications-Construction--PR_316103">state-owned</a> construction company. The decision has rekindled <a href="http://atimes.com/2016/03/sri-lanka-will-not-allow-military-base-for-china-port-city-project-given-green-light/">alarm</a> in India that the project will give China a naval base just 150 miles off India’s southeast coast.

CHEC’s status as an arm of the Chinese state, Indian <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/navy-alert-to-chinese-nuclear-submarine-threat-in-indian-ocean-767781">concerns</a> about China’s increasing activity in the Indian Ocean, and Sri Lanka’s strategic positioning between the Strait of Malacca and China’s new base at <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2016/02/confirmed-construction-begins-on-chinas-first-overseas-military-base-in-djibouti/">Djibouti</a> make CPC more than a construction project; it has become a barometer of Chinese influence in South Asia. Conversely, the tangled history of CPC shows the limits of India’s ability to project power in its immediate region. India’s concerted attempt to bring Sri Lanka more firmly back into its orbit have been no match for China’s greater economic power.

CPC was the brainchild of previous Sri Lankan president Mahindra Rajapaksa. During Rajapaksa’s administration, China became Sri Lanka’s largest <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2015/01/29/new-sri-lankan-government-hobbled-by-old-chinese-debts/">investor</a> and largest creditor: in 2013 China provided 21 percent of foreign loans and grants to Sri Lanka, and by 2015 Sri Lanka owed China between $3.8 and $5 billion dollars. In 2014 Sri Lanka repeatedly <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/sri-lanka-acts-to-ease-tension-over-visits-by-chinese-subs">allowed</a> Chinese subs to dock at Colombo without giving India prior notification, as Sri Lanka had agreed to do. One such port call took place during a state visit to Sri Lanka by Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe.

The sub visits crystalized Indian concerns about Rajapaksa’s shift toward China, and India appears to have taken steps to help Rajapaksa’s opponents win the presidential election held in January 2015. The month before the election Reuters reported that Colombo had <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sri-lanka-election-india-insight-idUSKBN0KR03020150118">expelled</a> the station chief for the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), India’s foreign intelligence agency, on the grounds that he had been meeting with opposition political leaders. After his defeat (but while he was campaigning for parliamentary elections held later the same year), Rajapaksa <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-asia/rajapaksa-says-raw-rallied-opposition-to-his-presidency/article6987869.ece">accused</a> RAW of helping to rally multiple opposition parties to create a united front in the elections.

The election of Maithripala Sirisena as Sri Lanka’s president seemed at first to be a victory for India; Sirisena <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sri-lanka-election-india-insight-idUSKBN0KR03020150118">met</a> with India’s high commissioner just hours after results were announced but took six days to find time for China’s ambassador. Within two months of the election, the CPC project was also put <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/diplomacy/article/1742272/shock-chinese-backers-billion-dollar-sri-lanka-project-runs">on hold</a> amid <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/south-asia/article/1740594/whose-airspace-it-fresh-row-sri-lanka-over-chinese-funded-port">reports</a> that under the terms of the deal, China would own the airspace above the port. And during a visit to Sri Lanka by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi—the first in decades—the two sides <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-sri-lanka-to-partner-on-oil-storage-project-prime-minister-narendra-modi-746324">agreed</a> that India would develop a strategic oil storage hub at Trincomalee. The previous Sri Lankan government had <a href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/sri-lanka-hardens-stand-on-pact-to-lease-oil-storage-to-ioc/article5335273.ece">blocked</a> that project in 2013.

Given this promising beginning, India likely did not expect to be back at square one: work on CPC has restarted, with only minimal changes to the deal. Under the new <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-15/china-back-to-work-as-sri-lanka-unblocks-1-4-billion-port-city">terms</a>, China will lease all of the land rather than acquire perpetual title to <a href="http://www.slguardian.org/2015/03/chinas-challenges-after-regime-change-in-sri-lanka/">20 acres</a> of the project. Sri Lanka has also <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/sri-lanka-aims-to-have-free-trade-agreement-with-china-116030200760_1.html">reiterated</a> its desire to sign a free trade agreement with China while at the same time <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-will-never-sign-cepa-with-india-pm-wickremesinghe/article7966271.ece">rejecting</a> a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with India in favor of a <a href="http://www.hirunews.lk/127908/cepa-was-stronger-than-etca-indian-high-commissioner">weaker</a> Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement. Modi has <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/india-pushes-for-comprehensive-economic-partnership-with-sri-lanka-115031300864_1.html">pushed</a> hard for the CEPA, which has been on the table since 2008, but Sri Lanka is wary of expanding its trade deficit with India, which is already over <a href="http://comtrade.un.org/data/">$3 billion</a>.

The Sirisena administration’s decision to balance India and China rather than side decisively with India is a result both of China’s economic allure and India’s diplomatic missteps. Despite a <a href="http://www.adb.org/countries/sri-lanka/economy">projected</a> growth rate of 7 percent in 2016, Sri Lanka is struggling economically. In February, as Sri Lanka <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21692944-island-turns-imf-despite-strong-growth-taxing-times">sought</a> a loan from the International Monetary Fund to help shore up its currency, the Fitch credit rating agency <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSFit950402">downgraded</a> the country’s sovereign debt rating to B+ with a negative outlook. Borrowing has become <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/8b26dc3c-7c9a-11e5-a1fe-567b37f80b64.html">more expensive</a>, and the billions Sri Lanka owes China will start to come due in five years. In early March, the country’s cabinet unveiled an <a href="http://www.sundaytimes.lk/160306/columns/emergency-budget-cabinet-approves-sweeping-tax-reforms-185319.html">emergency budget</a> that increased tax rates in order to meet Sri Lanka’s debt servicing burden of $8.2 billion a year. In this environment, it proved difficult for the government to turn down a major investment in infrastructure.

But it was also wishful thinking to assume that any Sri Lankan government would be comfortable remaining entirely in India’s orbit. The long, fraught history of relations between the two states includes <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/rajiv-gandhi-assassin-diary-sivarasan-exclusive-revelations-about-sivarasan-plot-to-kill-rajiv-gandhi/1/346167.html">assassination</a> and <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=XNK4ChtjZ7QC&amp;pg=PT171&amp;dq=Operation+poomaalai&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS__n2hdrLAhXLJB4KHa2kBUkQ6AEIODAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Operation%20poomaalai&amp;f=false">quasi-invasion</a>. More recently, Prime Minister Modi, under <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-parties-express-concern-over-lankan-presidents-stand/article8198729.ece">pressure</a> from powerful Tamil political parties whose support he needs in Delhi, has publicly intervened in the Sri Lankan political process. During his March 2015 visit, Modi <a href="http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-03-16/news/60174884_1_prime-minister-narendra-modi-13th-amendment-tamil-parties">called</a> for Sri Lanka to implement the 13<sup>th</sup> amendment to its constitution, which guarantees a federal structure that would preserve the rights of the Tamil minority.

This is not India’s first attempt to interfere in a neighbor’s constitutional process in order to protect a cross-border ethnic group. After India asked Nepal to make <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/neighbours/make-seven-changes-to-your-constitution-address-madhesi-concerns-india-to-nepal/">seven alterations</a> to its draft constitution, protesters on the Indian side of the India-Nepal border in Bihar shut down a key border crossing for <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Madhesis-call-off-protest-end-India-Nepal-border-blockade/articleshow/50903495.cms">five months</a>. Indian authorities at best stood by and at worst helped to <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/nepal-india-border-constitution-protests-idINKCN0RQ0AI20150926">close the border</a>. With India no longer supplying gasoline, Nepal was forced to impose <a href="http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-lifts-fuel-rationing/200399.html">fuel rationing</a>—although it did receive nearly <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/in-fact-india-has-old-ties-with-nepal-china-has-cash-and-tact/">350,000 </a>gallons of free gasoline from China. There can be little doubt that Sri Lankan leaders are carefully observing this example of strong-arm diplomacy.

Sri Lanka’s reversals on CPC are a reminder that India can’t assume that its neighbors will welcome its dominance in South Asia. India is surrounded by countries that are hungry for development dollars, whatever the source, even as they are occasionally made uneasy by China’s demands. India has the potential to offer an alternative: transparent, sustainable, and mutually beneficial development. But to achieve this equilibrium it will have to deal with its neighbors as equals, not as subordinates. India’s history in Sri Lanka and Nepal shows that it is still adjusting to this reality.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Creating Seamless Maritime Security Coalitions in the Indo-Pacific</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The rapid expansion of China’s political, economic, and military power in the Indo-Pacific presents both opportunities and challenges for the region. China’s rapid military build-up and assertive behavior could heighten tensions, especially over regional maritime disputes, and produce seriously adverse effects.

A policy of outright containment or isolation of China would be both inappropriate and counterproductive. Regional states should instead seek to improve cooperation among themselves in order to pressure Beijing to conform to, and fulfill its responsibilities under, established international law and norms. They must also establish a defense posture that will allow them to hedge against a deterioration in the regional security environment.

At the same time, regional countries should take every opportunity to involve China in bilateral and multilateral talks to avoid the danger of unintended maritime clashes, prevent inordinate military build-ups or an irrational arms race, and foster a habit of cooperation among regional militaries. Greater transparency and confidence-building measures will be the keys to achieving these objectives.

In this context, it is imperative that China and other regional states establish bilateral maritime and air communication mechanisms, including holding regular dialogues, setting up hotlines to manage crises, and introducing common military communication systems. China and Japan will hopefully sign such agreements in the near future.

<strong> </strong>The Indo-Pacific region faces a range of both traditional and non-traditional security issues. Maritime security issues are of particular importance and must be tackled by regional players. States should reaffirm the need to respect and comply with international maritime law and practice, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). They should also emphasize the importance of freedom of navigation and sea lane security. These are critical elements in further expanding trade safely throughout the sea lanes in the region.

The majority of regional countries strongly believes that China, as a country aspiring to be a strong maritime power, should be more proactive in obeying international maritime laws and norms. Instead China’s assertive and hegemonic behavior in the South and East China seas has caused strong dissatisfaction in the region and heightened its neighbors’ vigilance.

Similarly, regional states want to see the United States ratify UNCLOS as soon as possible. Having all Indo-Pacific maritime countries become parties to the convention, and sincerely respect and comply with it, would serve as an important foundation for resolving or at least managing most of the region’s maritime disputes in.

<strong>Composing Maritime Security Coalitions </strong>

In the meantime, regional countries should seek to establish flexible mechanisms for collective maritime security cooperation. Confidence-building through official dialogue and information sharing, and cooperative maritime security exercises to tackle mutual threats would contribute to regional stability by preventing misunderstandings, reducing mistrust, and expanding the scope of common interests.

Regional countries have already displayed such collective maritime security cooperation in combatting non-traditional maritime threats. They have made cooperative efforts to tackle common concerns such as counter-piracy, combatting illicit trade, and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The region is also exploring greater cooperation on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, given the Indo-Pacific’s vulnerability to earthquakes, typhoons, and other disasters. Most states in the Indo-Pacific would like to see the reliable regional maritime powers, such as Japan, Australia, India, and the United States, play more important roles in these areas.

These reliable regional maritime powers are key players in maritime security and defense in the Indo-Pacific, sharing a wide range of common interests and seeing preservation of regional security and prosperity as regional public goods. They are the countries with the will and ability to contribute to regional security and stability, despite differences in maritime policy and capabilities, and other regional states have generally welcomed their initiatives. Establishing maritime security coalitions among these responsible powers that are as seamless as possible should therefore be a major focus of security and defense cooperation in the region.

The responsible regional maritime powers should pursue cooperation with each other and smaller neighbors in both traditional and non-traditional areas of maritime security, not through a formal alliance but via a chain of mini-lateral cooperative maritime security coalitions that would form a seamless whole. These coalitions would not be aimed at containing China or target it as a hypothetical enemy, but would rather be loose, voluntary associations providing universal maritime security as regional public goods.

Despite Beijing’s objections to what it views as a containment strategy by the region’s other maritime powers, most countries in the Indo-Pacific wish to take collective action to counter China’s perceived hegemonic maritime expansion. In order to do so effectively, smaller regional countries which share common interests should join in mini-lateral maritime security coalitions—for instance by sub-region, thereby taking advantage of their unique geographic and strategic needs. These coalitions would need to be backed by the United States, including its naval forces, and by the other responsible regional maritime powers—Japan, Australia, and India.

These maritime security coalitions should be allowed to build upon each other, bringing in as many sensible maritime nations as possible to blanket the Indo-Pacific in a layered, seamless chain of coalition. However, each coalition should remain mini-lateral—containing just a few countries in order to ensure the ability to build consensus within the grouping. This loosely organized by seamlessly connected chain of coalitions could help ensure stability in the region and counter China’s perceived attempt to establish hegemony over the maritime Indo-Pacific.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Balikatan Exercise Highlights Territorial Defense and Multilateral Approach</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On April 4, the annual Balikatan joint military exercise began in the Philippines, with China’s state media lambasting it as an example of how Manila is “involving outsiders in the territorial dispute in the South China Sea.”  Balikatan, meaning shoulder-to-shoulder in Tagalog, started as an annual exercise between Philippine and U.S. armed forces focused on humanitarian assistance, disaster relief operations and conventional warfare. But in recent years, it has become a multilateral event thanks to the involvement of the Australian Defense Force. This year’s joint exercise involved an estimated 5,000 troops from the United States, 3,500 from the Philippines, and 80 from Australia, down from the 11,740 combined troops that took part in Balikatan 2015. This year officers and service personnel took part in a single training scenario that took the form of three different events on the Philippine islands of Luzon, Panay, and Palawan.

Balikatan <em>2</em>016 was significant for three reasons: its greater emphasis on territorial defense; the presence of three Japanese Maritime Defense Force (JMSDF) ships as observers; and the visit of U.S. secretary of defense Ashton Carter. Coincidentally, this year’s military exercise took place as Manila and Washington prepare for the rotational deployment of U.S. forces at five Philippine military bases under the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA).

Historically, Balikatan exercises have been designed for various missions, including maritime security, territorial defense, humanitarian assistance, disaster mitigation, maritime law enforcement, and even environmental protection. This year’s military exercise heightened the territorial defense component, focused on improving the Armed Forces of the Philippine’s (AFP) capability for external defense and enhancing the two allies’ interoperability in maritime security and maintaining regional stability. The AFP tested newly acquired military materiel including FA-50 light combat aircraft, heavy landing craft (LCH), and M113 armored personnel carriers. The Philippine Air Force’s FA-50s trained with Hawker Hunters and A-10 Thunderbolts on air interception, interdiction, and ground support. The Philippine Navy’s LCHs joined a U.S. Navy dock landing ship in a maritime mobility exercise to enhance the two navies’ capability to respond to natural disasters.

The highlight of the Balikatan exercise was the deployment and test-firing of the U.S. Marine Corps’ M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) in Crow Valley on April 14.  This was the first time that this type of weapon system was used by the Marines in Balikatan and the first time it was deployed in the Pacific. With a maximum range of 186 miles (300 kilometers), the HIMARS is among the newest, most advanced mobile and land-based weapons in the Marine Corps’ arsenal. The U.S. military also deployed several air and land assets that supported Philippine and U.S. ground troops simulating retaking an oil-and-gas platform and launching an amphibious operation on a hypothetical South China Sea island.

This year’s exercise was also significant because of the presence of three JMSDF ships in the Philippines during the start of the military exercise. Two Japanese destroyers and a submarine arrived in Subic Bay on April 2 ahead of the start of the annual military exercise. Inside Subic Bay, the three Japanese ships joined seven U.S. Navy vessels that were docked in the port for Balikatan. The destroyers JS <em>Ariake </em>and JS <em>Setogiri</em> and the submarine JS <em>Oyashio </em>then participated in a series of confidence-building activities with the Philippine Navy. The three Japanese vessel did not take part in Balikatan but were invited to observe the exercise. This is an indication that Japan is interested in joining the annual military training exercise, and will probably participate in next year’s Balikatan. But the participation of the Japanese Self Defense Force in the 2017 exercise will only add to China’s trepidation that Balikatan is being used by the Philippines “to  involve outsiders”  in the South China Sea dispute.

Another first in this year’s Balikatan was the visit of Defense Secretary Ashton Carter to observe the exercise. Carter is the first U.S. defense secretary to observe Balikatan in its 32 year history.  He observed the test firing of the HIMARS in Crow Valley and spent time onboard the USS <em>John Stennis</em>, alongside Philippine defense secretary Voltaire Gazmin, as the aircraft carrier transited the South China Sea. Carter also visited Antonio Bautista Air Base in Palawan, one of the five agreed locations where U.S. forces will be stationed on a rotational basis under EDCA. And in closing Balikatan, Carter announced that several U.S. military aircraft and helicopters would remain at Clark Air Base north of Manila. His presence during the exercise underscored the political significance of the Balikatan program for the two allies. U.S. Marine Lieutenant General John Toolan noted that Carter’s visit was intended to “reaffirm that the [security] relationship the U.S. have with the Philippines is rock solid.”

These three features of Balikatan 2016 reflect the changing nature of the Philippine-U.S. alliance in light of the heightened tensions generated by China’s expansion in the South China Sea. Although the alliance will still address non-traditional security challenges like natural disasters and terrorism, it is now being directed to maritime security and territorial defense. The participation of Australia, and possible inclusion of Japan next year, is an indication that other U.S. allies are being drawn into this geostrategic cauldron. It also highlighted that the Philippine-U.S. alliance will become more strategically relevant as the five agreed locations under EDCA enable the United States to revive its deterrent posture in the face of Chinese actions.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As U.S. defense secretary Ashton Carter visited the Philippines at the end of the annual <a href="http://amti.csis.org/balikatan-exercise-highlights-territorial-defense-multilateral-approach/">Balikatan</a> military exercises between the Philippines and the United States, anxiety was quietly building over the possibility that China would create a new artificial island on Scarborough Shoal, very close to Manila. Such an undertaking would come as the Philippines experiences a transition in political leadership via presidential elections in May. Despite hopes in Manila, Carter did not offer an official assurance of U.S. assistance in preventing Scarborough from being permanently taken over by China, though his visit, which included a trip with Philippine defense secretary Voltaire Gazmin to a U.S. aircraft carrier transiting the South China Sea, was intended to signal Washington's commitment to the alliance.

The general U.S. policy of neutrality on questions of sovereignty over South China Sea land features was originally established in the 1930s in response to <a href="http://www.combinedfleet.com/SouthChinaSea_t.htm">Japan's pre-war annexation</a> of the Paracel and Spratly islands. But Scarborough Shoal was treated separately and very differently from those island groups up until the 1990s. Unlike the Paracels and Spratlys, Scarborough was among the territories <a href="http://www.imoa.ph/bajo-de-masinloc-scarborough-shoal-less-known-facts-vs-published-fiction/">transferred by the United States to the Philippines upon the latter's independence</a>, though the shoal was not widely known. The <a href="http://photos.state.gov/libraries/164311/tratados_bilaterales/Insular%20Possessions%20Bevans%20623.pdf">1900 Treaty of Washington</a> between Spain and the United States clarified that any and all territories administered by Spain as part of the Philippine Islands, even if they were located outside the original<a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/sp1898.asp"> 1898 Treaty of Paris</a> lines circumscribing the Philippine archipelago, were ceded to Washington. <a href="http://www.imoa.ph/bajo-de-masinloc-scarborough-shoal-less-known-facts-vs-published-fiction/">The United States took over Spain's administration</a> of Scarborough for purposes of <a href="http://www.scmp.com/article/1007189/1916-court-case-shows-manila-owned-shoal">safety of navigation</a>, fishing, research, search, rescue, and <a href="http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1916/mar1916/gr_l-10051_1916.html">salvage activities</a>. In 1938, upon official inquiries, the U.S. Department of State recognized that the United States acquired title to the shoal from Spain on the basis of the 1900 treaty, and subsequently allowed Scarborough's transfer to the Philippines with concurrence of the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of Commerce. (<a href="#docs">See primary documents</a>)

The Philippines took over the shoal's administration in 1946 upon its independence. After <a href="http://www.imoa.ph/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/FIGURE-008.png">the Philippine Navy twice destroyed smugglers' bases</a> on the shoal in 1963, a 20-nautical-mile Naval Operating Area was established around it, turning Scarborough into a gunnery range and extension of U.S. military bases in the Philippines. The security perimeter kept out any further incursions by private parties, but seasonal fishing and occasional surveys and scientific research were allowed. The area was regularly used by Philippine and U.S. military forces openly and publicly until the U.S. bases closed in 1991. Only afterward did China actually take concrete action to assert its <a href="http://www.irasec.com/ouvrage34">long-dormant paper claim</a> to the shoal, beginning with the issuance of amateur-radio licenses to hobbyists in 1994. These later intensified into the assertion of traditional fishing rights into the early 2000s that eventually grew into a claim based on historic rights and title, and finally culminated in China's coercive exclusion of all Philippine fishing and law enforcement activities from the shoal since 2012.

At first blush, Scarborough presents a possible red line for the Philippine-U.S. military alliance. As a former U.S. territory transferred to the Philippines, it may be covered by the <a href="http://www.gov.ph/1951/08/30/mutual-defense-treaty-between-the-republic-of-the-philippines-and-the-united-states-of-america-august-30-1951/">Mutual Defense Treaty</a> that obligates the United States to help defend not only the Philippine metropolitan territory, but also "island territories under its jurisdiction." Should the Philippines decide to deploy its ships to <a href="http://amti.csis.org/developing-scarborough-contingency-plan/">prevent the approach</a> of vessels intended for island-building, Manila would expect the United States to make good on <a href="http://www.gov.ph/2012/05/09/statement-of-secretary-del-rosario-regarding-the-philippines-u-s-mutual-defense-treaty-may-9-2012/">assurances</a> that it will help defend Philippine "public ships and aircraft," (meaning not only military vessels) from armed attack in the Pacific, including the South China Sea, as required by the treaty. It could be argued that employment of the same kinds of tactics Chinese maritime law enforcement or militia vessels used against the Vietnamese in 2014 in their confrontation over the deployment of an oil rig in contested waters, which included the deliberate ramming and sinking of smaller, weaker vessels by larger though lightly armed Chinese ships, would still qualify as an armed attack. Ramming, after all, is an <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/hellenisticinnovations/naval/">age-old tactic</a> used in naval warfare.

The transformation of Scarborough into an artificial island-fortress similar to <a href="http://amti.csis.org/mischief-reef-tracker/">Mischief Reef</a> would be the endgame in China's rush to establish and consolidate administrative control over the South China Sea. Not only the Philippines, but other littoral states, the United States, Japan, and allied powers have an interest in preventing this, given how China has employed nominally-civilian assets in "grey zone" activities that push the envelope of tolerable behavior at sea. If the South China Sea were "captured" through the completion of what some view as a "<a href="http://nbr.org/publications/element.aspx?id=862">strategic triangle"</a> for monitoring and controlling maritime activities, including shipping and air traffic, these countries should be expected to do whatever was necessary to neutralize that strategic advantage. Despite their reservations over great power competition, Southeast Asian states will not quietly surrender sovereign rights guaranteed by international law. Against overwhelming power, the only logical recourse is to gravitate closer together, and join with external powers. Thus, by undertaking island-building on Scarborough, China could well create the final catalyst for its own strategic containment.

Prior to his announcement, CSIS reports on <a href="http://csis.org/publication/asia-pacific-rebalance-2025">Asia-Pacific naval capabilities</a> and <a href="http://csis.org/files/publication/160401_Shearer_AustJapanUSMaritime_Web.pdf">Australia-Japan-U.S. maritime cooperation</a> argued for greater bilateral cooperation on UUVs, which were also on show at the first naval exhibition in <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/unmanned-vehicles-loom-large-at-japan-naval-tech-expo-1.346326">Yokohama, Japan,</a> last year.

Heightened interest in the role of UUVs in the Asia-Pacific region prompts questions about their operational role and likely strategic implications. In principle almost any undersea task could be accomplished by autonomous systems, but in reality missions are more limited:
<ol>
	<li>Mine countermeasures (MCM) are the main missions for UUVs, as reducing threats posed by sea mines, saving operators’ lives, and improving operational efficiency make a perfect match. As a consequence, concepts of operations are available and technology has matured. For example Australia, China, Japan, Singapore, and Thailand all use UUVs manufactured by local and foreign suppliers such as <a href="https://www.atlas-elektronik.com/what-we-do/unmanned-vehicles">Atlas Elektronik,</a> <a href="http://www.ecagroup.com/en/defence-security/naval-forces">ECA,</a> <a href="https://www.km.kongsberg.com/HYDROID">Hydroid/Kongsberg,</a> and <a href="http://saab.com/naval/underwater-systems/">Saab</a> for MCM.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
	<li>Most Asia-Pacific navies combine UUVs for MCM with intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). ISR missions that go beyond MCM, such as battle space intelligence preparation, still need to mature, as they are more demanding in terms of concepts and technology. Some navies in the region also balance operational benefits with geostrategic risks and decide not to use UUVs for covert ISR as these missions could be seen as intrusive by neighbors.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
	<li>Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) is an emerging UUV mission resulting from significant investments in submarines across the Asia Pacific. Despite this, many navies in the region still have significant undersea capability gaps. This has triggered interest in UUVs. China is said to be discussing UUVs for ASW, and Singapore and Australia, who are both modernizing their submarine portfolio, might have an interest in the future.</li>
</ol>
So far, the United States enjoys undersea superiority. The U.S. Navy has been the leading user of UUVs and a key force for UUV-related research and development, but challenges remain.

First, the <a href="http://csbaonline.org/publications/2015/01/undersea-warfare/">discussion</a> on the impact of adversarial anti-access and area denial (A2AD) capabilities, such as submarines and powerful undersea sensors and networks, on U.S. power projection is in full swing. With undersea risks rising, UUVs could become key levers. However, information degradation will reign high in A2AD environments, so UUVs need to become more autonomous. Thus today’s focus on keeping human operators in full control of autonomous systems might not fully reflect counter-A2AD requirements.

Second, the U.S. Navy’s “<a href="http://www.informationdissemination.net/2015/12/whats-driving-navy.html">Away Game</a>” operational concept, which uses forward deployment to protect and project U.S. power around the globe, translates into specific requirements such as mission endurance and multi-role capabilities also relevant for UUVs. The U.S. undersea strike capacity will “<a href="https://issuu.com/csbaonline/docs/csba6102_offset_strategy_report_fin_12d361be465156?e=15123547/10908051">plummet by more than 60 percent relative to today by 2028</a>,” and the U.S. Navy envisions closing this gap with UUVs. In this regard, submarine design plays a key role. The <em>Virginia</em>-class payload module might be perfect for <a href="http://www.navaldrones.com/LDUUV-INP.html">Large Displacement UUVs (LDUUV)</a>, but few other navies have the same submarine capability. Taking the LDUUV idea to the next stage, Extra-Large UUVs are being considered as “<a href="http://csbaonline.org/publications/2015/10/undersea-warfare-game-changers/">trucks to deliver other payloads and UUVs</a>.” All this leads to a very specific UUV philosophy that might deter others from following the U.S. example.

Third, Russia and China, two geostrategically important submarine nations, are developing their own UUVs. Both share an interest in the missions discussed above, but their ambitions go beyond. Among others, they are interested in developing solutions to counter adversarial UUVs. In addition, China seems interested in using UUVs to defend sovereignty claims at sea, and the Russian company <a href="http://rostec.ru/en/news/4516773">Rostec</a> is working on UUVs to track surface ships and support undersea camouflage.

So, will UUVs soon tilt the Asia Pacific’s undersea balance toward offensive action? No, this is not yet in the cards. Disruptive innovation is not part of the strategic culture of key U.S. partners such as <a href="https://www.routledge.com/products/9781138787230">Singapore, South Korea,</a> and <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13523260.2014.928070">Japan.</a> In addition, most regional navies have until recently focused on defensive and localized naval tasks, which also explains the focus on MCM. Clearing sea corridors of sea mines enables naval intervention, but even in this case UUVs are not yet used offensively. Finally, even while attempting to counter the United States, current thinking on UUVs within Russia and <a href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR990.html">China</a> largely takes place within the conceptual paradigm set by their competitor.

This, however, could change. <a href="http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=18104">Russia</a> has in the past shown a top-notch capacity for thinking about the impact of new technology on war fighting concepts. And China’s more assertive coast guard could start using UUVs, which would be challenging since adequate responses in the grey area between naval tasks and law enforcement at sea are lacking. In addition, both nations are warming to the idea of undersea <a href="http://www.cnas.org/the-coming-swarm">swarms</a> with UUVs.

In order to hedge against these and other strategic uncertainties in the Asia-Pacific region, CSIS scholars have suggested a federated defense approach that “<a href="http://csis.org/files/publication/131216_FederatedProject_Concept_Overview.pdf">knits together a geopolitically significant defense capability</a>.” For UUVs to support federated defense, the United States should consider three policy options:

<em>Let allies and partners decide what they really need</em>. U.S. allies and partners in the Asia-Pacific region operate UUVs at different levels of maturity. Overall, they need time to understand how to best use them in both shallow and blue waters, as requirements are very different. It is tempting for the United States to project its own philosophy onto allies and partners as this also enables interoperability. This, however, poses risks that allies and partners will become locked into a U.S. approach that might be unsustainable given their respective budgetary environments. Therefore U.S. self-restraint that stimulates genuine UUV concepts developed by Asia-Pacific allies and partners will be more sustainable than copying U.S. approaches.

<em>Advance UUV proficiency through joint exercises</em>. Joint exercises are the best means to increase allied UUV proficiency. For years, the U.S. Navy has been organizing naval exercises in the <a href="http://www.cusnc.navy.mil/IMCMEX">Arabian Sea</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_RIMPAC">Pacific Rim</a>, which include training in the use of UUVs for MCM. In the Asia Pacific, this focus should be broadened to include ASW. In addition, it would be useful to involve maritime security actors such as coast guards, fisheries authorities, and customs in order to provide Asia-Pacific allies and partners the opportunity to develop comprehensive UUV approaches involving different stakeholders.

<em>Bring in European partners</em>. Given growing economic ties, European partners also have a strategic interest in stable Asia-Pacific waters. Thanks to their defense industrial capacity, Germany, France, Norway, and Sweden already play an important role in equipping Asia-Pacific undersea forces. Integrating European partners into the federated UUV approach would effectively create a bridge between EU and NATO undersea forces and partners in the Asia Pacific. This would provide navies the option to choose the systems that best serve their interests, while the U.S. Navy would remain the ultimate “<a href="http://thediplomat.com/2016/03/why-australia-should-go-with-germany-for-its-future-submarine-project/">strategic integrator</a>.”]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Has Taiwan Implicitly Clarified the U-Shaped Line?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Philippines filed an <a href="http://amti.csis.org/a-case-of-rocks-islands/">arbitration case</a> in 2013 against China before the Permanent Court of Arbitration to challenge, among other things, Beijing’s nine-dash line claim to most of the South China Sea. Although the legal character of the nine-dash line is not a new dispute between China and its neighbors, it has become a significant foreign policy and international legal headache for another South China Sea claimant: Taiwan. This is because China claims that its nine-dash line is a successor to the U-shaped line map issued by the Republic of China (ROC) in 1947. By doing so, China both asserts its sovereignty over Taiwan and diverts some international political pressure from Beijing to Taipei.

Against this background, Taiwan faces international pressure over whether it should explicitly clarify and define the legal character of the U-shaped line in accordance with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). For Taiwan, the interpretation of the U-shaped line is not merely a legal issue. It involves how Taiwan balances its strategic relationship with both the United States and China. If the Permanent Court of Arbitration either invalidates the Chinese nine-dash line or narrows the possible legal interpretations of the line, it will provide other claimants and partners like the United States with powerful political leverage against Beijing. This in turn has led to pressure on Taiwan to clarify its own claim of the U-shaped line.

But is such a clarification really necessary? Taiwan has never explicitly made excessive maritime claims in the South China Sea, and is in fact constrained from doing so by its own actions.

Since the issuance of the 1947 map, Taiwan has never claimed a historical entitlement to all the waters within the U-shaped line. As a matter of international law, this means that Taiwan already adheres to the legal principle of <em>mare liberum</em>, which stresses freedom of navigation and that the ocean cannot be occupied. Therefore, it is hard to imagine Taiwan would claim the waters within the U-shaped line as its exclusive territorial.

Taiwan’s legal options vis-à-vis the U-shaped line are also constrained because in 2005 Taipei suspended the 1993 Policy Guidelines for the South China Sea. The guidelines” were an executive order issued by the Executive Yuan (Cabinet). Their original function was to coordinate each ministry’s functions relevant to the South China Sea and consolidate them under one legal instrument. The preamble of the guidelines says, “(The ROC) has jurisdiction over the maritime area within the <em>historical waters line</em> and enjoys all the rights and interests within it.” Although the preamble does not explicitly identify this “historical waters line,” there is no line but the U-shaped line on Taiwan’s official map of the South China Sea. By suspending the guidelines in 2005, Taiwan discontinued its claims to historical waters. Legally speaking, though “suspension” implies that the guidelines might be restored in the future, the longer they remain suspended, the more difficult such restoration will be. Even were the guidelines and their provisions for a historical waters line restored, they would be attacked under the principle of estoppel in international law.

The illustration of the U-shaped line on an <a href="https://www.land.moi.gov.tw/content/5835-U.pdf">official map</a>, “The First ROC Territorial Baseline and Territorial and Contiguous Zone Lines,” also constrains Taipei’s legal options. There is a brief footnote on the map noting, “All of the islands and rocks of the Spratly Islands within the traditional U-shaped line are ROC territory.” The map therefore suggests Taiwan claims only territorial sovereignty over the islands and rocks within the U-shaped line, not historical rights or sovereignty over the waters within the line. If Taiwan’s government regarded historical rights and waters as an indispensable interest within the U-shaped line, there would be no reason to exclude mention of them from the map. This does not necessarily prevent Taiwan from taking action to claim historical rights and waters in the future, but it does provide ammunition against Taipei were it to do so.

It is also difficult for Taiwan to make excessive maritime claims in the South China Sea because any changes to the nation’s South China Sea policy garner significant public scrutiny. Even though the two major political parties in Taiwan have somewhat different positions on South China Sea policy due to their conflicting attitudes toward Beijing, neither has any incentive to substantially change the policy status quo for fear of being punished, either by constituents or international actors (especially China and the Unites States).

A series of responses by Taipei in the South China Sea over the last two years have placed the issue under even greater public scrutiny. When the government of President Ma Ying-jeou proposed the <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.tw/en/theme.aspx?n=E5A0D5E2432C234D&amp;s=83376F561B7165E6&amp;sms=BCDE19B435833080">South China Sea Peace Initiative</a>, issued a <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.tw/en/News_Content.aspx?n=1EADDCFD4C6EC567&amp;s=EDEBCA08C7F51C98">Statement on the South China Sea</a>, and took actions to bolster its argument that <a href="http://amti.csis.org/exploring-itu-aba-virtual-tour-south-china-sea-islet/">Itu Aba</a> (Taiping) Island is legally an island and not a rock, it was criticized by politicians and commentators who accused it of a willingness to cooperate with China. However, under such intense domestic social scrutiny, it will be politically impossible for the government in Taipei to make assertive claims based on the U-shaped line or even cooperate with Beijing.

Scholars usually list four potential meanings for the U-shaped line: 1) A territorial sea or boundary line; 2) A historical waters line; 3) A historical rights line; and 4) A claim to the islands within it. By its own state practice, Taiwan has, for now, largely constrained itself to only the islands claim.

At present, Taiwan has no reason to explicitly interpret the legal character of the U-shaped line. Its long-term state practices have implicitly reassured the United States that Taiwan is not cooperating with China while at the same time remaining acceptable to Beijing. If the ruling in the South China Sea arbitration case goes against China, Taiwan and the United States should be even more careful not to upset the current balance. For now, maybe saying nothing is the best means for Taiwan to contribute to stability in the South China Sea.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The gradual, but steady development of China’s ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) program has been closely monitored by international observers. China is the last of the Permanent Five members of the United Nations Security Council to establish an operational SSBN force. A recent report by the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) says that China’s <em>Jin­­</em>-class SSBN represents the country’s “<a href="http://www.oni.navy.mil/Portals/12/Intel%20agencies/China_Media/2015_PLA_NAVY_PUB_Interactive.pdf?ver=2015-12-02-081058-483.">first credible at-sea second-strike nuclear capability</a>.” That goal remains a long way off, however. Although the <em>Jin­</em>-class is a potential step forward for China’s nuclear deterrent, its nascent SSBN program continues to face considerable challenges.

A secure second-strike capability requires that some portion of a country’s nuclear forces survive an enemy’s first strike. By virtue of being able to hide in the vastness of the ocean, SSBNs have the potential to be an essential component of China’s nuclear second-strike capability. A reliable long-range submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), capable of striking a target at intercontinental range with a nuclear payload, is critical to this strategy. The JL-2 SLBM carried by the <em>Jin­</em>-class can deliver between one to three nuclear warheads to an estimated range of <a href="http://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2015_China_Military_Power_Report.pdf">7,400 km</a>. The relatively short range of the JL-2 requires China’s SSBNs to travel undetected through several crucial chokepoints into the Pacific Ocean <a href="http://www.lowyinstitute.org/files/nuclear-armed-submarines-in-indo-pacific-asia-stabiliser-or-menace_0.pdf">in order to strike the continental United States</a>.

<a href="http://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Submarines_with_flags_Apr_2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-4468"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4468" src="https://amti.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Submarines_with_flags_Apr_2.jpg" alt="Submarines_with_flags_Apr_2" width="612" height="792" /></a>

This shortcoming requires China to rely on the stealth of the <em>Jin­</em>-class to sail the submarine into firing position. However, available information suggests that the <a href="http://fas.org/irp/agency/oni/pla-navy.pdf"><em>Jin</em>-class is detectable</a> by foreign Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) assets.  According to a 2013 report in <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/chinas-ballistic-missile-submarines-how-dangerous-9414"><em>The National Interest</em></a>, the <em>Jin­</em>-class may have fundamental flaws that create a detectable sonar signature. Evidence of this vulnerability can be found in a <a href="http://fas.org/irp/agency/oni/pla-navy.pdf">2009 ONI report</a>, which compared the low-frequency noise of China’s SSBN force to Russian/Soviet submarines, and revealed that the <em>Jin­</em>-class was the noisier than Russian <em>Delta III</em>-class SSBNs that were first commissioned in the mid-1970s.

China also faces the technological and bureaucratic hurdles of establishing effective command and control (C2) with its SSBNs. Reliable C2 communication with decision makers on the mainland and firing protocols for when an SSBN loses contact with its national command authority <a href="https://fas.org/blogs/security/2014/04/chinassbnfleet/">are critical to ensuring that an SSBN</a> only fires when it is absolutely necessary. Contacting an SSBN when it is submerged requires <a href="chinapower.csis.org/ssbn">advanced communications technology</a>.  Salt water only permits radio waves to penetrate a short distance into the ocean, requiring communication stations to use Very Low Frequency (VLF) or Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) radio waves to signal a submarine. An alternative option for relaying information to submarines comes from aircraft like the U.S.-E-6B TACAMO that trails a several-miles-long antenna to signal submarines at shallow depths. Little is publicly known about China’s communications infrastructure; however the Chinese navy maintains VLF facilities at <a href="http://www.smeter.net/stations/vlf-stations.php">Changde and Datong</a>.

China may seek to improve its infrastructure on reclaimed land features in the SCS to help secure safe passage for its SSBNs to the Pacific Ocean. Establishing control of the waters within the nine-dashed-line could potentially lessen the drawbacks of the current submarine base on Hainan Island, as submarines operating out of the base are <a href="http://rips.or.jp/Policy_Perspectives/RIPS_Policy_Perspectives_No.20.pdf">exposed to ASW forces</a> of the United States and other countries. The <a href="http://amti.csis.org/seeing-the-forest-through-the-sams-on-woody-island/">placement of HQ-9 surface-to-air missiles on Woody Island</a> with a range of 125 miles, which could be deployed on other land features, may empower China to counter foreign ASW aircraft during a crisis. China’s own ASW forces may also play a key role. Establishing airbases for its emerging aviation-ASW program might eventually enable China to counter enemy attack submarines charged with tracking China’s SSBN fleet.

These efforts could potentially enhance China’s second strike capability while a new, quieter SSBN and longer range SLBM are under development. There is limited available information on the development of new submarine and missile technology, making it unclear when China will be capable of fully addressing the aforementioned problems. In any case, securing safe passage into the SCS is only a partial solution. China’s SSBNs must still traverse the long journey from their home base on Hainan Island, through strategic chokepoints, to locations far away from the safety of China’s protected coastal waters - a task that might prove extremely difficult for China’s current fleet of <em>Jin­­</em>-class SSBNs.

		<title>Taipei’s Risky Agreement with Beijing on Okinotorishima</title>
		<link>http://amti.csis.org/taipeis-risky-agreement-beijing-okinotorishima/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Taipei recently launched a “<a href="http://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/International-Relations/Taiwan-begins-freedom-of-navigation-patrol-near-Okinotori">freedom of navigation</a>” operation in the western Pacific to challenge Japan’s claim to a 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone around Okinotorishima, an atoll located 950 nautical miles south of Tokyo and 850 nautical miles east of Taiwan. Two Taiwanese government ships, possibly escorted by a warship, have been sent to the Japanese-claimed waters—where the Japan Coast Guard detained a Taiwanese fishing boat on April 25—to demonstrate Taipei’s determination to protect Taiwanese fishery rights.

Taipei’s reaction runs counter to its own security. It has joined Beijing (and Seoul) in challenging Tokyo’s claim that Okinotorishima is an island entitled to a full exclusive economic zone (EEZ) as defined by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Beijing and now Taipei insist that Okinotorishima falls under the UNCLOS category of rocks “which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own,” and therefore has no EEZ or continental shelf. Located between Guam and Taiwan, Okinotorishima has played an important role for the security of Taiwan. Beijing therefore wants to deny Japan’s jurisdiction over the waters around Okinotorishima in order to conduct <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part13.htm">scientific surveys</a> necessary for submarine operations without Tokyo’s permission.

In case of a military threat to Taiwan, the waters around Japan’s southernmost atoll would become a maritime bridgehead from which the U.S. Seventh Fleet could project power to support Taiwan. In other words, those waters are where the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy would conduct anti-access/area-denial operations and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force would conduct sea control operations to ensure U.S. freedom of action. Taipei’s “freedom of navigation” operation, by implicitly supporting Beijing’s right to conduct surveys in the waters around Okinotorishima without Tokyo’s approval, are therefore against Taiwan’s own strategic interests.

The timing was unfortunate, too. A decision from the <a href="http://amti.csis.org/a-case-of-rocks-islands/">international tribunal</a> deciding a case between Manila and Beijing over the South China Sea dispute is expected in a few weeks. Taipei is concerned that the court might rule on whether the largest natural islet in the South China Sea—the Taiwan-occupied <a href="http://amti.csis.org/exploring-itu-aba-virtual-tour-south-china-sea-islet/">Itu Aba</a> (Taiping) Island—is a rock or a full island under UNCLOS, and as a result might be seeking to highlight how Itu Aba differs from a tiny atoll like Okinotorishima. But Taipei’s move also opens room for Beijing to avert international criticism of its land reclamation in the South China Sea by criticizing Tokyo for not preserving UNCLOS provisions.

Little is known about what triggered Taipei’s unusually strong reaction to the April 25 arrest of Taiwanese fishermen, but it is possible that the government of outgoing President Ma Ying-jeou hoped to embarrass President-elect Tsai Ing-wen, who is seen as being pro-Japan. Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has actually denounced Tokyo for detaining the Taiwanese fishermen. But Joseph Wu, who will become secretary-general of the National Security Council under Tsai, told reporters that sending armed vessels to protect Taiwanese fishing boats requires “careful consideration.”

This is a test for the strategic partnership between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Tsai, and between Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the DPP. Given Taipei’s interest in negotiating an agreement guaranteeing the right of Taiwanese fishermen to operate in the waters around Okinotorishima, one way to resolve this dispute would be to conclude a civil fishery agreement in which Taipei implicitly acknowledged Japan’s sovereign rights while gaining access to fishery resources. Such an agreement might be justified as a joint effort to prevent overfishing of tuna under the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean—one of the few international conventions to which Taipei is a party.

Tokyo and Taipei should turn this difficult moment into a chance to conduct unofficial maritime security dialogue. Some Taiwanese are concerned about Japan’s plan to provide patrol ships to the Philippine Coast Guard for fear that those ships will be used to suppress Taiwanese fishing boats in disputed waters in the South China Sea. There is an urgent for Tokyo and Taipei need to narrow their misunderstanding of each other’s maritime security policies. Taiwan and Japan can also cooperate in promoting Taipei’s accession to more international fishery treaties. Meanwhile, the two parties should review the implementation of the 2013 <a href="http://amti.csis.org/the-japan-taiwan-fishery-agreement-strategic-success-tactical-failure/">civil fishery agreement</a> in the East China Sea to prevent fishermen from operating against the cooperative spirit of the agreement.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After months of grueling and highly polarizing election campaigning, the Philippines has finally chosen its next set of leaders. Rodrigo Duterte, the firebrand and highly controversial mayor of Davao City, appears to have won a landslide victory, beating the closest runner-up, former interior and local government secretary Mar Roxas, by a whopping five million votes.

The Commission on Elections, which was at the receiving end of countless criticisms ahead of election day, managed <a href="http://verafiles.org/comelec-2016-elections-with-fastest-transmission-rate/">to pull off</a> one of the most credible and transparent presidential elections in Philippine history. There was relatively little election-related violence, and few irregularities or delays, with more than 99 percent of vote counting machines functioning successfully. With the exception of the tightly-contested vice-presidential race, where Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr., <a href="http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/05/10/bongbong-marcos-suspects-elections-cheating.html">has raised</a> doubts about the credibility of the vote, the election results have been largely welcomed by all major candidates.

Mar Roxas, the anointed successor of President Benigno Aquino, made a <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/132579-mar-roxas-concession-speech">conciliatory concession speech</a>, wishing Duterte success. The president-elect’s <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/132531-trillanes-acknowledges-duterte">fiercest critics</a>, including the Catholic hierarchy, have <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/569331/cbcp-head-asks-bishops-to-reach-out-to-people-they-have-offended">also extended</a> an olive branch. After months of anticipation, during which the Philippine peso became <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-27/philippine-vote-doubts-sink-peso-as-mayor-likened-to-trump-leads">a regional underperformer</a>, markets have responded positively to the election outcome, with Philippine stocks hitting <a href="http://www.rappler.com/business/economy-watch/132739-philippine-stocks-elections-rodrigo-duterte">their highest mark</a> in 9 months.

Duterte, who is <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/784974/i-will-be-a-dictator-vs-bad-guys-duterte">currently assembling</a> a cabinet filled with seasoned technocrats, has promised to <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/785018/duterte-swears-he-wont-swear-again">become more</a> statesmanlike and oversee a pragmatic and competent administration. Crucially, he has also <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/world/asia/philippines-election-rodrigo-duterte.html?_r=0">expressed his willingness</a> to reach out to China and find a <em>modus vivendi</em> vis-à-vis the South China Sea disputes. <a href="http://english.cctv.com/2016/05/05/VIDEr8FZBkWg3Pi0mo9UNpAO160505.shtml">For him</a>, development rather than deterrence is the way forward.

<strong>A New Era</strong>

Only a few months ago, Duterte was considered <a href="http://opinion.inquirer.net/94430/the-political-outsider">a political outsider</a> and a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/07/opinion/why-filipinos-are-voting-for-a-new-dictator.html">loose canon</a> with little chance of capturing the presidency. He was up against major establishment candidates such as Vice President Jejomar Binay, a populist who built a massive network of support across the country, and Mar Roxas, a seasoned technocrat who benefited from the gargantuan machinery of the incumbent administration. The race, however, was mostly dominated by neophyte senator Grace Poe, who combined a reformist platform with a populist aura, thanks to her late father Fernando Poe, Jr., who was long considered the king of the Filipino movie industry.

But several factors helped Duterte to outmaneuver his opponents. These included his <a href="http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/rich-media/125524-podcast-inside-track-duterte-campaign-social-media-peter-lavina">social media</a> blitzkrieg, which presented Duterte as having singlehandedly transformed the Hobbesian city of Davao into one of the safest and most prosperous in the country as mayor, and an emerging zeitgeist of <a href="http://news.abs-cbn.com/halalan2016/nation/04/20/16/duterte-marcos-lead-show-grievance-politics-analyst">grievance politics</a> against poverty, crime, corruption, and poor public infrastructure.

Duterte also benefited from the pitfalls of his opponents. Binay was hobbled by <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/121436-ombudsman-upholds-charges-binay-makati-carpark-building">corruption scandals.</a> Roxas made the crucial mistake of presenting himself as essentially a referendum on the Aquino administration, which has <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/679329/aquino-trust-approval-ratings-plunge-to-lowest-levels-after-mamasapano-clash">suffered from declining popularity</a> in the national capital region and other parts of the country. <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/131050-grace-poe-legend-imagined-president">As for Poe</a>, she struggled with a lingering legal ordeal regarding her eligibility, while seeming to pander to specific interest groups and associate with reviled oligarchs.

Though lambasted for his foul-mouth and off-the-cuff comments, Duterte managed to convince a large plurality of voters that he was the only “authentic,” independent candidate in the race with the requisite political will to address the country’s profound challenges.

<strong>Foreign Policy Recalibration </strong>

Despite his foul mouth and off-the-cuff comments, Duterte is no Donald Trump. Unlike the American real estate mogul, Duterte, a former prosecutor, boasts more than two decades of experience in government. Despite some of his Trump-like foreign policy statements, <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/785007/duterte-grounds-jet-ski-vs-china">particularly the suggestion</a> the he would drive a jet ski to and plant the Philippine flag on contested islands in the South China Sea, Duterte is widely expected to adopt a pragmatic posture in foreign affairs, particularly toward China.

Throughout his interviews and speeches, Duterte has signaled his willingness to have direct dialogue with the Chinese leadership and, if possible, even negotiate a joint development agreement in contested waters. This pragmatic rhetoric reached a crescendo when he openly said of China, "Just <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/128807-duterte-railway-systems-china-legacy">build [the Philippines] a train around Mindanao, build me a train from Manila to Bicol...build me a train [going to] Batangas</a>. For the six years that I'll be president, I'll shut up [about sovereignty disputes]."

Duterte is considering appointing to his cabinet former officials from the administration of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (2001-2010). These reportedly include former defense secretary <a href="http://aboutcagayandeoro.com/gibo-teodoro-back-duterte-reserved-cabinet-position/">Gilbert “Gibo” Teodoro</a> and former armed forces chief <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/784974/i-will-be-a-dictator-vs-bad-guys-duterte">General Hermogenes Esperon</a>. Though Duterte, who came of age during the Vietnam War years, is known <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/philippines-election-dutertes-vow-to-communists-may-trigger-coup/news-story/d4088ba9843e75d89aee1af1515573ad">for his affiliation</a> with leftist groups, he is expected to <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/philippine-voters-hand-economys-reins-to-crime-fighter-duterte-1462878167">adopt</a> a strategy of balancing relations equally between China and the United States.

<a href="http://amti.csis.org/elections-change-manilas-south-china-sea-policy-not/">Dispensing with</a> the Aquino administration’s counter-balancing strategy against Beijing, Duterte is focused on inviting large-scale Chinese investments and avoiding conflict in the South China Sea. He has <a href="http://english.cctv.com/2016/05/05/VIDEr8FZBkWg3Pi0mo9UNpAO160505.shtml">shed doubt</a> on the utility, if not wisdom, of the Philippines’ <a href="http://amti.csis.org/arbitration-101-philippines-v-china/">arbitration case against China</a>, and it is possible that Duterte will simply treat the likely favorable verdict as an advisory opinion and, in exchange, demand China <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/asias-new-battlefield-the-philippines%E2%80%99-south-china-sea-15985?page=show">show good will</a> in the disputed waters. For instance, he might expect China to refrain from building military facilities on Scarborough Shoal and allow Filipino fishermen and troops to enjoy unrestricted mobility across the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.

Relations with the United States, meanwhile, are expected to remain robust, particularly with respect to counter-terrorism. Given the United States’ <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-javad-heydarian/philippines-forgotten-rev_b_8199354.html">huge favorability</a> among the Philippine security establishment, media, and populace, no Filipino leader can afford to alienate Washington without suffering significant political backlash.

Yet it is possible that Duterte, whether <a href="http://www.update.ph/2016/05/duterte-us-military-must-follow-guidelines-prescribed-by-afp-under-edca/5331">out of “nationalistic” convictions</a> or based on prospective negotiations with China, may not dramatically expand U.S. access to Philippine bases under the newly approved <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-set-to-deploy-troops-to-philippines-in-rebalancing-act-1458466797">Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement</a> (EDCA). He could be expected to drive a harder bargain with the United States compared to the incumbent administration. Lamenting a <a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/126835/duterte-to-military-attaches-ph-not-out-for-war-china-should-just-let-us-fish-in-seas">lack of full-fledged</a> U.S. support for the Philippines against China, a Duterte administration could demand greater clarity on the extent of the U.S.-Philippines mutual defense treaty.

Despite all the commotion over the U.S. pivot or rebalance to Asia, the level of foreign military financing the United States proves to the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/council-on-foreign-relations/pivot-asia-security_b_9830182.html">Philippines is actually lower</a> than in 2010, and minuscule compared to what it sends to Middle Eastern and European partners. So one could expect Duterte to bargain for greater assistance from Washington. In short, a Duterte presidency could mean playing the United States and China against each other without necessarily siding with either camp. Depending on the issue at hand, he will also explore greater cooperation with other external powers.

Having only garnered a plurality of the votes, however, Duterte doesn’t enjoy political <em>carte blanche</em>. In fact, it is doubtful whether he could have won in a head-to-head contest with his closest opponent. If he wants to stay in power, and avoid any major backlash from his legions of critics, including the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGi5vlOCgIk">outgoing president</a>, Duterte will need to make sure that he does not dramatically depart from the status quo, both on domestic and foreign policy.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>EDCA and the Projection of U.S. Air Power in the South China Sea</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On April 19, four A-10C Warthogs flew from Clark Air Field to the vicinity of Scarborough Shoal, 140 nautical miles from the main Philippine island of Luzon. The flight of the A-10s near the shoal was a <a href="http://warontherocks.com/2016/05/successful-signaling-at-scarborough-shoal/">subtle message</a> to China that the United States would risk military escalation to deter Chinese reclamation at this disputed feature. The A-10Cs were part of a Pacific Command Air Force rotational deployment in the Philippines, which included eight aircraft and 200 personnel in total. They constituted the first in what will become a regular cycle of U.S. Air Force rotations in the country, laying the foundation for joint air patrols between the Philippines and the United States. The follow-on rotations of U.S. aircraft and personnel in the Philippines will be determined in consultation with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) as provided for by the 2014 <a href="http://amti.csis.org/philippine-supreme-court-approves-edca-unlocking-door-return-u-s-strategic-footprint-southeast-asia/">Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement</a> (EDCA).

<strong>Implementing EDCA</strong>

<strong> </strong>EDCA’s main goal is to extend U.S. military assistance to the AFP modernization program through the establishment of a U.S. presence at Philippine military bases across the country. Development of the agreed locations within AFP bases means that the U.S. military will shoulder the cost of upgrading infrastructure for both Filipino and American use, boost disaster response readiness by prepositioning supplies, and facilitate further training between AFP and U.S. military units, specifically in maritime security and territorial defense.

During the sixth annual Bilateral Security Dialogue (BSD) held in Washington on March 18, U.S. and Philippine defense officials announced that American forces would be allowed access to five AFP bases: Antonio Bautista Air Base on the western most island of Palawan; Basa Air Base and Fort Magsaysay on the main island of Luzon; Lumbia Air Base in northern Mindanao; and Mactan-Benito Ebuen Air Base on the central Philippine island of Cebu. The two allies’ utilization of these AFP facilities will enhance their respective security interests, in light of China’s maritime expansion in the South China Sea, by expanding joint military exercises and training and, more significantly, enabling the United States to deploy a credible deterrent force in Southeast Asia (on a rotational basis) for the first time since 1992.

For the United States, having access to these facilities will allow it to deploy more troops, equipment, and planes, in accordance with its strategy of rebalancing to Asia. This will allow the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Marine Corps Aviation to apply a version of the Cold War-era “<a href="http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/archives/2013/08/13/pacific-shift-new-assignments-and-duty-stations-in-throwback-to/78541556/">Checkered Flag</a>” model, wherein tactical air formations based in the United States will deploy to Asian facilities for training. This will give these tactical air units the chance to train in an environment where they might actually be called upon to fight. And like the annual Balikatan joint Philippine-U.S. military exercise, rotational deployments will allow U.S. aircrews and support personnel to become familiar with air operations in the Philippines.

The implementation of EDCA will assist the AFP with developing a credible defense posture as it revives its air defense capabilities. Philippine Air Force fighter pilots will be able to train with their U.S. counterparts at the four airbases among the agreed locations. The Philippine Air Force will also be able to make use of facilities built or improved upon by U.S. forces. Finally, EDCA implementation will go hand-in-hand with implementation of the Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative, through which the U.S.  Department of Defense is expected to spend $425 million over five years to help boost the capabilities of Southeast Asian states. The <a href="https://news.usni.org/2016/04/18/the-philippines-at-forefront-of-new-pentagon-maritime-security-initiative">lion’s share</a> of the $50 million requested for FY2016—or about  $42 million—will be allocated to the Philippines.

<strong>Depriving the Dragon of its Lair</strong>

Once U.S. forces are deployed to the five agreed locations, these facilities will have significant strategic implications in the South China Sea. American use of these operationally flexible facilities spread across the sprawling Philippine archipelago will render Chinese planning and  efforts to deny U.S. forces the ability to operate in disputed waters much more difficult, if not  futile. Use of these airfields would facilitate the rapid deployment of U.S. air assets from Guam, Hawaii, Australia, and elsewhere in case of a crisis in the South China Sea.

In such an event, U.S. forces operating from the agreed locations could confound China’s anti-access/area denial planning. U.S. fighter planes, reconnaissance aircraft, and drones operating from these facilities could augment a carrier strike group’s complement of over 70 aircraft, increasing its defensive capabilities when operating in the South China Sea. Air-refueling tankers operating from these locations in the Philippines could also increase the combat radius of carrier-based F/A-18 multirole fighters. With midair refueling capabilities, a carrier strike group operating in the Philippine Sea could launch long-range air assets for strike missions in the South China Sea and even along the southern coast of China.

<strong>Bringing Back U.S. Deterrent Posture</strong>

During the Cold War, U.S. military facilities in the Philippines enabled the United States to maintain a strategic presence in the South China Sea to enhance its long-term interests of ensuring freedom of navigation, and performing its role as the offshore strategic balancer in East Asia. However, after 1992, the withdrawal of American forces from the Philippines removed any substantive U.S. military presence along the South China Sea, and has constrained what the two allies can do together in their security partnership. In the face of China’s maritime expansion, the agreed locations under EDCA will become pivotal not only in kick-starting the alliance visa increased training and enhanced interoperability, but also in reviving a U.S. deterrent posture along the South China Sea.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Hard Power Meets Soft: Obama’s Visit to Vietnam</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[President Barack Obama’s historic visit to Vietnam, during which he announced the complete lifting of a long-standing U.S. ban on lethal weapons sales, culminated the process of normalization between Vietnam and the United States. In the joint statement with President Tran Dai Quang, <a href="http://vietnam.usembassy.gov/obamavisit_052316_joint_press_conference.html">Obama emphasized</a> that the lifting of the ban “will ensure that Vietnam has access to the equipment it needs to defend itself and removes a lingering vestige of the Cold War.” In addition, defense cooperation measures to strengthen the Vietnamese coast guard were announced, and Obama, referencing the South China Sea issue, <a href="http://vietnam.usembassy.gov/obamavisit_052316_joint_press_conference.html">reiterated that</a> “the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows, and we will support the right of all countries to do the same.”

Obama’s visit was hugely popular with the Vietnamese people, many of whom crowded the streets in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City to welcome him. Newspapers and the online sphere were filled with positive comments about Obama’s embrace of the local culture and food and his open and relaxed style. Photos of Obama eating <em>bun cha</em> and posts about his sensational speech in Hanoi have been flooding the newsfeed of millions of Vietnamese Facebook users in the past few days.

Undoubtedly the visit signals the desire of both countries to deepen cooperation and their willingness to tackle thorny issues. Taking steps to address Washington’s concerns about human rights, Hanoi will receive the Peace Corps and has granted Fulbright University Vietnam permission to operate as the country’s first nonprofit, independent university, not subject to any constraints by the central government on its curriculum. Obama’s visit will also help to further lock-in Hanoi’s commitment to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, with respect for independent labor unions arguably the most noteworthy.

While these upgrades in U.S.-Vietnam relations are apparent, Obama’s visit and the lifting of the lethal weapons sale ban need to be situated in the context of the U.S.-China-Vietnam triangle and Beijing’s assertiveness in the South China Sea. Contrary to President Obama’s <a href="http://vietnam.usembassy.gov/obamavisit_052316_joint_press_conference.html"> insistence that</a> “the decision to lift the ban was not based on China or any other considerations,” but only “on our desire to complete what has been a lengthy process of moving towards normalization with Vietnam,” one can argue that concerns about China and its moves in the South China Sea loom large.

This trip is not just about the United States enlisting the support of Vietnam in order to constrain China. It is also about the United States pulling Vietnam closer to its own orbit more generally. In the short term, the visit and the lifting of the ban carry symbolic importance. First, they signal that the change in leadership after the 12th Party Congress in January will not fundamentally alter Vietnam’s foreign policy direction. While some speculated that the leadership change would bring Vietnam closer to China for ideological reasons, Vietnam’s “pivot” to the <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/vietnams-pivot-america-will-continue-15581">United States will continue</a>. Obama’s visit confirms that.

Second, the trip signals that a “<a href="https://www.uscg.mil/seniorleadership/DOCS/CS21R_Final.pdf">cooperative strategy for 21st century sea power</a>,” will continue to emerge in the region, and it will not be easy for Beijing to apply a divide and conquer strategy. Shortly before the president’s trip, China sent three delegations to Vietnam. It is unclear what went on behind the scenes, but Chinese officials likely tried to warn Vietnam against deeper cooperation with the United States, potentially citing the risk of “peaceful evolution”—a euphemism for gradual U.S.-backed regime change. If true, the success of Obama’s trip indicates that Vietnam is not willing to yield to such pressure from the Chinese side. The recent development of Vietnam-U.S. relations might be able to convince leaders in power that “peaceful coexistence” between a one-party communist state with a democratic superpower is possible.

Besides its short-term symbolic importance, the lifting of the arms sale ban can enhance Vietnamese capacities in the long-term. Right now, Vietnam’s naval and air defense platforms were mostly purchased from Russia, which poses an obstacle to the integration of new U.S. hardware. In addition, Vietnam’s purchasing power is relatively constrained. However, in the long-term, the lifting of the ban will open the door to more advanced capabilities, helping the country to protect its status quo in the South China Sea. There could eventually be joint maritime patrols between the U.S. and Vietnamese navies, and a more robust U.S. commitment to ensure maritime security and stability in the South China Sea.

Furthermore, the lifting of the U.S. lethal weapons embargo is a crucial starting point for more robust defense cooperation. The fact that the United States allows Vietnam to buy its weapons despite remaining differences regarding human rights issues is bound to have some spillover effect in the long-term. This decision will allow both sides to build mutual trust, which will permit more far-reaching cooperation. The United States has long expressed its desire to return to Cam Ranh Bay naval base, and recently, there have been intensive talks on both sides on how to make such a return possible without unsettling China too much. Cam Ranh occupies a strategic location in the South China Sea, as it is closer to the disputed Spratly Islands than any major Chinese naval base.

To deter Beijing from continuing to change the status quo in the South China Sea and militarizing the dispute, Vietnam must cooperate with the United States. Ultimately, the greatest value of such cooperation, both bilateral and multilateral, lies in the ability to send a strong deterrence signal to China. Whether Vietnam’s deepening cooperation with the United States will pay off depends on how China perceives these signals.

One can imagine two likely scenarios. In the first, stronger U.S.-Vietnam ties and the confidence gained by Vietnam as a result of the president’s visit might help to dissuade China from taking aggressive actions against Hanoi (e.g. placing another oil rig in Vietnam’s claimed exclusive economic zone, attacking Vietnamese fishermen/coast guard, ejecting Vietnam from some of the features it occupies in the South China Sea). Another possibility is that the visit could irritate Beijing and encourage it to apply political and military pressure on Hanoi. Since China and Vietnam share a common border, troop movements near the border can be used as a military threat by Beijing at any time. A dual strategy of carrots and sticks might be used to “quarantine” U.S. influence on Vietnam. Therefore, it is recommended that Vietnamese leaders adopt a cautious stance in the aftermath of the Obama visit in order to avoid damaging relations with Beijing.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How Taipei Should Handle the Tribunal Ruling on the South China Sea</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The South China Sea is not at the top of Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen’s agenda, but for the sake of domestic stability, U.S.-Taiwan relations, and cross-strait relations, her newly-installed Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government must exercise caution in its handling of the Philippines’ <a href="http://amti.csis.org/a-case-of-rocks-islands/">arbitration against China</a>. How Tsai handles the ruling will prove critical for Taipei, as a wrong step could be misconstrued as an indication of the government’s intent to pursue Taiwan’s independence, which has the potential to create a crisis in cross-strait relations and complicate relations with Washington.

During the Ma Ying-jeou administration, the South China Sea was viewed as an opportunity to promote Taiwan’s voice and role as a peacemaker. This was most clearly seen in Ma’s South China Sea Peace Initiative, which he launched in May 2015. However, in the final year of Ma’s presidency, he garnered more criticism than praise from the United States because of visits by officials--including Ma himself--to Taiwan-occupied <a href="http://amti.csis.org/exploring-itu-aba-virtual-tour-south-china-sea-islet/">Itu Aba</a> (Taiping Island) to uphold Taiwan’s sovereignty and the Ma administration’s <a href="http://amti.csis.org/podcast/">rejection of the pending ruling</a> from the tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the The Hague.

Unlike Ma’s Kuomintang, the DPP is prioritizing domestic issues, such as revitalizing the economy, and is unlikely to seek ways to enhance Taiwan’s role in managing the South China Sea disputes. So far, the DPP has advocated resolving the disputes in accordance with international law, including the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), safeguarding freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea, and preserving Taiwan’s sovereignty. In her May 20 inaugural speech, President Tsai asserted her commitment to safeguarding the sovereignty and territory of the Republic of China (ROC) and proposed setting aside disputes in both the East and South China seas to create an environment conducive to pursuing joint development. This carefully worded statement signals to Beijing that the DPP will not fundamentally alter Taipei’s approach to maritime issues.

Going forward, the DPP is likely to continue to exercise caution in dealing with the South China Sea issue. When the ruling is issued, since Taipei is not a party to the case, there is no requirement for the DPP to comment extensively. To win the support of the United States as well as the other claimants, Tsai’s government will probably not explicitly reject the ruling, regardless of its content. The top concern will be the decision of the tribunal regarding Itu Aba, which the Philippines’ case contends is a rock that is only entitled to a 12-nautical-mile territorial sea, but which Taiwan insists is an island entitled to a 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ).

There are three possible outcomes for Itu Aba: it is downgraded to a rock, is ruled an island, or no ruling is made on its status.

If Itu Aba is downgraded to a rock, Taipei should express disappointment while still respecting the ruling, although steps will have to be taken to reassure the Taiwan public that the government will protect the nation’s sovereignty claims. Since this will be a shift in Taiwan’s policy, Tsai should clarify to Beijing that her purpose in not repeating the Ma administration’s rejection of the ruling is to present Taiwan as a law-abiding actor, not to instigate a crisis with China.

If Itu Aba is determined to be an island, Taipei should welcome the ruling and publicly guarantee to adhere to the status quo in the South China Sea. In addition, the DPP should privately emphasize to the international community, especially to the United States, Japan, and ASEAN, that Taipei’s position is not an indication of cooperation with Beijing on the South China Sea.

The best outcome of the case for Taiwan would be no ruling at all on Taiping’s status. This has less potential to increase tensions with Beijing or create a domestic backlash. Should this be the ruling, the DPP can respect the decision without reservations. This outcome also allows Tsai to concentrate more heavily on domestic policy.

Regardless of the decision on Itu Aba, President Tsai should maintain Taiwan’s South China Sea sovereignty based on perspectives of history, geography, and international law. Additionally, Tsai should continue to advocate that all parties seek to resolve the South China Sea dispute peacefully, whether through dialogue or legal channels, as well as jointly uphold freedom of navigation and overflight.

The other issue that poses a challenge to the new DPP government is a likely tribunal ruling that essentially finds China’s nine-dashed line—which derives from the ROC’s <a href="http://amti.csis.org/taiwan-implicitly-clarified-u-shaped-line/">eleven-dashed line</a>—inconsistent with UNCLOS. Since Taiwan is not a party to the case, there will not be immediate pressure on Taiwan to clarify its claim. However, in the longer run, Taipei will need to decide how to deal with the ROC’s 1947 map that created the eleven-dashed line. Information publicly available to-date suggests that the map was intended to lay claim only to the land-features inside the eleven-dashed line, not the waters. The DPP government will have to decide whether to remain ambiguous about its claim or take a clear position. Consideration should be given to opening the government archives to the public so that scholars worldwide can review the relevant documents.

Finally, Tsai should avoid publicly encouraging China to abide by the ruling. That task should be left to other countries. Doing so would cause unnecessary friction with Beijing at a time when cross-strait relations remain fragile.

Managing the South China Sea will be one of the most difficult early challenges for the new DPP government. It will have to avoid criticism from the public, meet U.S. expectations of differentiating Taipei’s position from Beijing’s, avert a crisis in cross-strait relations, win support from ASEAN, and advance Taiwan’s role as a law-abiding international player. It remains to be seen whether the new DPP government can successfully navigate these choppy waters.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Is India planning to install undersea surveillance sensors in the Bay of Bengal?

It is a question that has animated discussions in maritime circles recently. A recent report in the Indian media suggests New Delhi is planning to undertake joint projects with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/12/world/asia/india-japan-china-andaman-nicobar-islands.html?_r=0">Japan</a> and the <a href="http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/India-US-to-identify-new-ways-in-defence-cooperation/2016/06/04/article3466031.ece">United States</a> for the defense of its littoral spaces, including one for the installation of a sound surveillance sensors (SOSUS) chain in India’s near seas. In an <a href="http://www.forceindia.net/Defexpo2016Day2_UnderseaWeb.aspx">article</a> for a Indian defense magazine in April this year, Prasun Sengupta, a well-known analyst and commentator, surmises that New Delhi is considering Japanese assistance in the construction of an undersea network of seabed-based sensors stretching from the tip of Sumatra right up to Indira Point in the Bay of Bengal to prevent Chinese submarines from approaching Indian exclusive economic zone. According to Sengupta, besides providing funds for the upgrading of naval air bases and construction of new electronic/signals intelligence stations along the Andaman and Nicobar chain of islands, Tokyo plans to finance an undersea optical fiber cable from Chennai to Port Blair. Once completed, this network is likely to be integrated with the existing U.S.-Japan “Fish Hook” SOSUS network meant specifically to monitor People’s Liberation Army-Navy(PLAN) submarine activity in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean Rim.

The starting point for this collaboration is supposed to have been Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Washington last year, when India and the United States agreed to intensify cooperation in maritime security. New Delhi is said to have decided to move forward with its plans to strengthen its near-seas defenses after ASEAN defense ministers at the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting-Plus gathering in Lankawi, Malaysia, in March collectively stated their desire for India to play a security role beyond the Indian Ocean,

There is no official confirmation of these developments. However, it is entirely possible China’s anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) plans in Southeast Asia may have served as a trigger for an Indian response in the Bay of Bengal. In an <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/chinas-undersea-great-wall-16222">article</a> last month, Lyle Goldstein, a well known China specialist, claimed Beijing was in the process of creating an undersea “Great Wall” in the South China Sea by establishing an array of ocean-floor acoustic sensors to detect U.S. submarines. China’s hydrophone system is reportedly modeled on the U.S. Navy’s SOSUS, meant originally to track Soviet submarines in the mid-1950s. Reports that the PLAN is on the verge of operationalizing its sensor chain may have prompted New Delhi to pursue an undersea sensor project in the South Asian littoral.

The more interesting venture, from an Indian perspective, is between Japan and the United States in the wider Pacific. Since the early 2000s, when PLAN submarine patrols are supposed to have turned aggressive, the U.S. Navy and the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF) began setting up a chain of fixed arrays to monitor the movement of Chinese submarines in the East China Sea and South China Sea. This resulted in the establishment of the “<a href="https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/defence/2015/04/18/japan-and-us-enclose-chinese-coast-within-sensor-net/14293190401772">Fish Hook Undersea Defense Line</a>” in early 2005, stretching from Japan to Southeast Asia with key nodes at Okinawa, Guam, and Taiwan. The system reportedly consists of two separate networks of hydrophones, one stretching from Okinawa to southern Kyushu, and the other from Okinawa to Taiwan.

In July 2013, Beijing <a href="https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/defence/2015/04/18/japan-and-us-enclose-chinese-coast-within-sensor-net/14293190401772">claimed</a> that the United States and Japan had established “very large underwater monitoring systems” at the northern and southern ends of Taiwan. One supposedly stretched from Yonaguni to the Senkaku Islands, while the other covered the Bashi Channel down to the Philippines. In addition, Chinese analysts contended, large numbers of hydrophones had been installed “in Chinese waters” close to China’s submarine bases in Qingdao, Xiaopingdao, and Yulin on Hainan Island, even though it wasn’t fully clear if these sensors were all operational.

Fewer doubts remain about the efficacy of an older version of the SOSUS in the northeastern Pacific (off the Tsugaru Strait) and the southwestern Pacific (the Tsushima Strait) that Japan and the United States have jointly managed since the days of the Cold War. Analysts aver that Japan’s experience with working the system for over six decades has provided Japanese engineers and technicians with the proficiency and professionalism to install sea-based sensors in distant littoral spaces, including in the Indian Ocean.

New Delhi, however, would need to consider the implications of operating sensitive equipment with a foreign partner-- especially the sharing of critical sensor data. In the case of the joint Japan-U.S.SOSUS, for instance, while the JMSDF and U.S. Navy personnel jointly manage the JMSDF Oceanographic Observation Centre in Okinawa, all the information is available to the U.S. Pacific Command,as the facility is under the operational control of the U.S. Navy. Needless to say, there are concerns that India may be required to provide its foreign collaborators with a level of informational access with which the Indian navy may not be too comfortable.

Some observers worry that placing undersea sensors around the Andaman and Nicobar islands may ultimately result in deployment of other A2/AD tools that China might find provocative. Japan’s <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/japans-master-plan-destroy-the-chinese-navy-battle-14779">activation</a> of a coastal surveillance unit on Yonaguni Island, only 67 miles from the east coast of Taiwan, has been widely perceived to be an A2/AD measure. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-military-china-exclusive-idUSKBN0U107220151218">Reports</a> suggest that Japan’s far-flung islands may soon see the placement of<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-military-china-exclusive-idUSKBN0U107220151218"> mobile anti-ship missile batteries and air-defense systems to bolster A2/AD capabilities</a>.

Against the backdrop of a recent logistical agreement with the United States, and with other foundational pacts like the Communication Interoperability and Security Memorandum Agreement and Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geo-Spatial Cooperation in the pipeline, there are concerns that the establishment of an undersea sensor chainaround the <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2014/05/andaman-and-nicobar-islands-as-strategic-deterrent/">Andaman and Nicobar</a> islands might be a precursor to the placement of area-denial weapons – a move that Beijing would deem “escalatory.”

Inadequate return on investment constitutes another source of worry. The setting up of a listening array, experts aver, goes well beyond the placement of hydrophones on the seabed. A sound surveillance system requires steady economic and human investment, with the careful cultivation of an entire cadre of specialists able to interpret the array’s data output. The United States and Japan invested in their system for years before it began producing results. India could seek Japanese assistance in installing a SOSUS but could take years on training specialists and refining the related technologies.

Moreover, undersea sensors produce enormous quantities of raw data that require a dedicated system to sift and sort through. Over the years, the task of organizingthe data collected has become increasingly unviable. The lack of resources to manage data-collection facilities has led navies to consider a proposal to treat the data as a marketable commodity, by sharing it with environmental scientists and civilian agencies for a price. In order to allow the access of data in real-time,however, the hydrophones have had to be connected online, therebyraising concerns about the possible misuse of data.

Despite such worries, an Indian sound sensor array in the Indian Ocean could prove invaluable. For a country that has a major anti-submarine warfare handicap and a lack of operational submarines, an undersea sensor would be a godsend. India has so far not made any major investments in improving its sub-hunting capabilities. If it can install a deterrence system and operate it with a degree of competence, it could retain its strategic primacy in the Indian Ocean.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On July 12, a tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague issued its <a href="https://amti.csis.org/arbitration-ruling-analysis/">long-awaited ruling</a> on Manila’s case against Beijing’s claims in the South China Sea. An interactive map of the outcome is <a href="https://amti.csis.org/arbitration-map/">available here</a>. How many countries recognize the decision as legally binding on both parties and call for it to be respected will determine its ultimate value, as international pressure is the court’s only enforcement mechanism. AMTI has scoured publicly available, official statements in an effort to determine the real positions taken by countries. Since the ruling was issued, we have identified <strong>7</strong> countries that have publicly called for it to be respected, <strong>33</strong> that have issued generally positive statements noting the verdict but have stopped short of calling for the parties to abide by it, <b>9</b> that have made overly vague or neutral statements about the South China Sea without addressing the ruling,  and <b>5</b> that have publicly rejected it. It is useful to compare this evolving list with the public positions of countries before the ruling.

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WDDlAaz4B7_-3JXKNmFDSnv-ivt3pD_O8jDMBGdgfGs/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>

Chinese officials and state media before the ruling had trumpeted the number of countries voicing support for Beijing’s position that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction in the case and the ruling was therefore invalid. On the eve of the ruling, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed that number had <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/t1372136.shtml">climbed to more than 60</a>, but had not provided a list of the countries or, in most cases, evidence for their support. AMTI identified 65 countries that appeared to be included in China’s list of supporters before the verdict. Of those, <b>31</b> had publicly confirmed their support, <strong>4</strong> had denied Beijing’s claim of support, and <strong>26 </strong>had remained publicly silent or have issued statements that are considerably vaguer than indicated by China. In contrast, <strong>40</strong> countries had said that the arbitral award would be legally binding and had called on both China and the Philippines to respect it.

Support for China’s position ahead of the ruling was defined as an explicit public statement that 1) the arbitral tribunal lacked jurisdiction or legitimacy; 2) the right of states to choose their own method of dispute resolution should be respected (and therefore compulsory dispute mechanisms such as the tribunal are invalid); or 3) the right of states to exempt certain types of disputes from compulsory settlement as provided for by article 298 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea should be respected (which China claims invalidates the arbitral proceedings because they actually touched upon boundary delimitation, from which it has exempted itself).

AMTI will endeavor to keep this list constantly updated. If you believe we have overlooked or misinterpreted the statements of any countries, please email <a href="mailto:AMTI@csis.org">AMTI@csis.org</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Okinotori: A New Beginning for Taiwan-Japan Maritime Dialogue</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In late April, a <a href="http://amti.csis.org/taipeis-risky-agreement-beijing-okinotorishima/">dispute erupted</a> between Taiwan and Japan over fishing rights in waters off Okinotorishima, or Okinotori Reef. The Taiwan-registered fishing vessel Dongshengji No. 16 was seized by the Japanese coast guard near Okinotorishima, in waters which Japan claims as part of its 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ). After the incident, then-president of Taiwan, Ma Ying-jeou, issued a statement in protest, refusing to acknowledge that Okinotorishima is entitled to an EEZ. On top of that, he dispatched Taiwanese coast guard vessels to the disputed waters to protect fishing operations there, bringing bilateral relations to a freezing point.

Less than a month later, on May 20, the Democratic Progressive Party’s (DPP) Tsai Ing-wen was inaugurated as the new president of Taiwan. Cabinet spokesman Tung Chen-yuan declared on May 23 that a bilateral dialogue mechanism on maritime affairs would be launched before the end of July. He said its main goals would be to foster cooperation on maritime affairs and establish a mechanism to reduce the risk of maritime disputes to prevent damaging friendly bilateral ties.

In contrast to the Kuomintang (KMT), which led the previous government, the DPP has always been regarded as Japan-friendly. Since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took office in Japan, a number of his cabinet members have visited Taiwan and met with the DPP while it was still the major opposition party, thus establishing good relations with Tsai even before she became president. But as a result, Taiwanese fishermen are deeply concerned the Tsai administration could sacrifice their interests as part of its Japan-friendly policy.

Faced with this criticism the Tsai government has taken a very cautious stance. On the one hand, the government fears it could alienate fishermen and hand the KMT a reason to attack the government. But on the other, it worries it might lose a good opportunity for deepening relations with Japan. Consequently, the Tsai administration has taken a rather ambiguous stance on the Okinotorishima issue.

The Tsai government went so far as stating that it would not take any specific legal stance on the issue until the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) delivers a recommendation on Japan’s claim to an extended continental shelf from Okinotorishima. But the CLCS does not have jurisdiction to decide whether or not Okinotorishima is legally an island entitled to an EEZ and continental shelf, and as a result has indefinitely postponed issuing a recommendation. The Tsai administration’s real intention is to create a friendly environment ahead of negotiations with Japan on broader maritime issues, and to prevent a stalemate in bilateral talks due to disputes over the legal status of Okinotorishima. The Tsai government is, of course, aware that stirring up controversy over the status of Okinotorishima would cause bilateral relations to stagnate, giving China an opportunity to sow division between Taiwan and Japan.

The Okinotorishima issue is not a question of territorial entitlement. Taiwan is not questioning Japan’s claim to Okinotorishima, only its claim to an EEZ and continental shelf from it. Taiwan argues that Okinotorishima does not meet the crucial conditions for island status set out in Article 121 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea—namely the ability to “sustain human habitation” or "economic life of their own.” Therefore, the islet is only a rock entitled to a territorial sea, and the waters beyond that 12-nautical-mile zone are the high seas where any nation is free to fish.

The bilateral dialogue mechanism on maritime affairs that the Tsai government wants to establish is not limited to waters near Okinotorishima, nor does it aim to address the boundaries of overlapping areas in the existing <a href="http://amti.csis.org/the-japan-taiwan-fishery-agreement-strategic-success-tactical-failure/">Taiwan-Japan Fisheries Agreement</a> in the East China Sea. Instead it endeavors to set up a comprehensive maritime dialogue mechanism at a higher level as part of “preventive diplomacy.” It will adopt “communicative measures” to ensure there is a mechanism in place that “nips conflict in the bud” should another maritime confrontation occur between Taiwan and Japan.

When disputes arise it is extremely important that a dialogue mechanism be in place. The situation in the South China Sea offers plenty of examples of what happens when one does not exist. In 1974 China and Vietnam engaged in a sea battle over the Paracel Islands. In 1988 the two nations fought another naval engagement over Johnson South Reef. Tensions heightened between China and the Philippines over the former’s occupation of Mischief Reef in 1995 and the latter’s grounding of a ship on Second Thomas Shoal in 1999. Another standoff occurred between China and the Philippines over Scarborough Shoal in 2012. In all of these cases, no systemized communication system or hotline existed between decisionmakers to manage crises.

In 2001 military aircraft from China and the United States collided over the South China Sea. The incident and its aftermath showed that the two sides were not able to communicate with each other immediately, misjudging the situation, because they lacked a mutual confidence mechanism. More than seven years after that incident, in April 2008, a U.S.-China military hotline was finally set up. In November 2014 the U.S. Department of Defense and China’s Ministry of National Defense signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the Rules of Behavior for Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters as well as a Memorandum of Understanding on Notification of Major Military Activities [and] Confidence-Building Measures Mechanism. In June 2015, China and the United States signed an Army-to-Army Dialogue Mechanism Framework Document.

Since Taiwan and Japan do not maintain formal diplomatic relations, the two sides are not able to publicly establish a hotline like the U.S.-China military hotline or rules of behavior for safety of unplanned military encounters. However, in the absence of such formal channels, the best approach to dispelling mutual misunderstandings is establishing a notification mechanism within the maritime law enforcement agencies and a hotline between the competent regulatory authorities on marine affairs. The two sides could even conduct joint maritime rescue drills, loan each other equipment to fight marine pollution, and conduct bilateral training and exchanges for law enforcement and marine affairs personnel.

In the short term it will, such mechanisms will not, of course, solve the problem of overlapping sea areas or clarify whether Okinotorishima is an island or a rock. However, they will help build a safe environment for fishermen during operations at sea and create opportunities for cooperation between marine law enforcement agencies on both sides by jointly safeguarding maritime security and protecting the marine environment.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Meeting Duterte: Why Kerry Should Visit the Philippines</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 40 months as secretary of state, John Kerry has visited 82 countries, logged over 1.1 million miles traveled, and spent 540 days on the road. This is an important, if grueling, signal about U.S. commitment to working with countries around the world. The secretary has spent most of his time where crises are most glaring: in Europe—coordinating on security, refugees, and economics—and in the Middle East—managing the Iran nuclear deal and Syria’s ongoing civil war. In 2015, Kerry spent over half his time in Europe, with no other region accounting for more than 10 percent of his travel days. That pattern has largely continued in the first half of 2016.

Challenges to U.S. interests and security in Asia are not as immediate as those posed by Russia in Europe nor as violent as in Syria. But the trend lines on security and diplomacy are moving in troubling directions. The international system, rooted in the equality of all countries, is being challenged by a Chinese approach that seeks recognition for itself as first among neighbors. China’s diplomatic blitz to establish—however ephemerally—international credibility for its opposition to the legitimacy of a tribunal in The Hague that is considering weighing some of its excessive claims in the South China Sea undermines both U.S. credibility and the legitimacy of arbitration as a peaceful dispute resolution mechanism. Like the challenges requiring the secretary’s time in Europe and the Middle East, these are not challenges that can be addressed in a bureaucratic, bottom-up way; they require leadership from the United States’ foremost diplomat.

Luckily, next month offers an opportunity for Secretary Kerry to demonstrate this leadership in an important way. He will be in Vientiane on July 26 for the ASEAN Regional Forum—the annual gathering of the foreign ministers of the 10 Southeast Asian countries that comprise ASEAN and their 17 dialogue partners. While in Asia, there is another, arguably more important opportunity for him to show leadership and advance U.S. interests: he should make a trip to the Philippines.

The Philippine president-elect, former Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte, will assume office on July 1. He is not well-known to the U.S. foreign policy establishment and could prove a difficult leader for the United States to work with if his support is taken for granted. Duterte is not reflexively pro-American and has expressed serious concerns about both the history of U.S. involvement in the Philippines and the credibility of the U.S. treaty commitment to defend his country. At the same time, he has indicated an adamancy about preserving Philippine claims in the South China Sea, even while indicating a willingness to engage more directly with China.

U.S. officials have had few previous opportunities for interaction with Duterte—President Barack Obama spoke with him by phone following his election and Ambassador to the Philippines Philip Goldberg was only able to travel to Davao on June 13 to meet him. Secretary Kerry should leverage his travel to the region to be the first cabinet official to meet with President Duterte, directly hear his objectives and what role (if any) he sees for cooperating with the United States, and reassure him of the seriousness of U.S. commitment to the mutual defense treaty. The secretary can reinforce the message the United States has delivered to the Philippines throughout the Obama administration, emphasizing the importance of partnership and cooperation to enhance the security of both the Philippines and the region as a whole.

The first step in securing the U.S.-Philippine relationship in the next administration is to meet with Duterte, listen to his views, and start that conversation. This is something only Secretary Kerry can do, and he should.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A crucial challenge that the new Philippine president will face after his June 30 inauguration will be whether or not to continue President Benigno Aquino’s geopolitical agenda by challenging Beijing’s expansive claims in the South China Sea. President-elect Rodrigo Duterte needs to weigh whether or not to pursue this agenda given other <a href="http://amti.csis.org/will-duterte-administration-mean/">foreign policy concerns</a> (e.g. economic diplomacy and protection of overseas workers) and the opportunity costs of a strained bilateral relationship with the second largest economy in the world. He must also take into account the geopolitical forces unleashed by his predecessor’s policy of challenging China’s expansive claims.

<strong>Challenging the Geopolitical Agenda? </strong>

During the presidential campaign, Duterte was critical of the Aquino administrations’ agenda in the South China Sea. He declared that he would be willing to hold bilateral talks with China over the dispute. Duterte also suggested the possibility of joint exploration of the South China Sea’s natural resources and said he would like to see China building railroads on the troubled island of Mindanao in exchange for his temporary silence on the maritime dispute. Duterte was also disparaging of the Philippine-U.S. alliance, saying he has little confidence that the United States would honor its treaty commitment to the Philippines when it comes to the South China Sea dispute.

After the election, however, the president-elect changed his tune. On Election Day, Duterte declared that if became president he would settle the territorial disputes in the South China Sea through multilateral negotiations that would include allies such as the United States, Japan, and Australia as well as claimant states. This is a reversal of his earlier position of relying on bilateral negotiations with China to resolve the territorial row. Duterte recently announced that he “will never surrender the Philippines’ sovereign right over <a href="http://amti.csis.org/scarborough-shoal-red-line/">Scarborough Shoal</a>” after holding talks with China’s ambassador to Philippines Zhang Jianhua. He also said he did not discuss the South China dispute with the Zhang because the Philippines is still anticipating the decision of an <a href="http://amti.csis.org/a-case-of-rocks-islands/">arbitral tribunal</a> in The Hague regarding the Philippines’ case against China. This showed a change in his previously cynical view of the case given China’s declaration that it will not accept the tribunal’s decisions. The incoming administration’s slow but sure about-face on its earlier South China Sea pronouncements was captured by incoming foreign secretary Perfecto Yasay’s recent statement “that relations with China should improve as long as China adheres to the rule of law, respects our [Philippine] territorial integrity and sovereignty.

Duterte also moderated his <a href="http://amti.csis.org/meeting-duterte-kerry-visit-philippines/">disparaging view</a> of Philippine-U.S. security relations. In late May, he declared that he was in favor of continuing the <a href="http://amti.csis.org/edca-projection-u-s-air-power-south-china-sea/">Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement</a> (EDCA) between the Philippines and the United States because of the <a href="http://amti.csis.org/edca-refocus-eyes-on-the-afps-modernization-program/">limited capabilities</a> of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). In a press conference, he said that he does not have a problem with EDCA, specifically the use of Philippine military bases by the United States, because the Philippines “don’t have good external defense capabilities.” His only qualification to EDCA’s implementation is that U.S. forces “could not use any other place without the knowledge or until there is advice from the [Philippine] Armed Forces.”

<strong>Minding Geopolitical Forces </strong>

<strong> </strong>Some analysts maintain that President-elect Duterte has a pragmatic foreign policy agenda for the Philippines characterized by pursuing efforts to keep the country’s security relations with the United States intact while exploring economic cooperation with China. Career diplomats in the Department of Foreign Affair, however, have observed that Duterte, like other presidential candidates, simply did not have a concrete foreign policy agenda regarding specific issues like the South China Sea, which will only be developed after this new administration takes office. Whether Duterte will continue Aquino’s policy of traditional geo-politics or pursue a policy of accommodation with China, he must take into account four factors.

First, the new president must consider public opinion vis-à-vis China. Since the 2012 Scarborough Shoal stand-off, the majority of Filipinos have developed an unfavorable image of China. In the aftermath of the stand-off, most in the Philippines have followed news on the South China Sea dispute and have a great distrust of China. Another factor that the new president has to consider is the AFP’s shift from internal security to external territorial defense—a vital component of the Aquino administration’s balancing policy toward China. If the new president decides to accommodate China, he or she must stop or slow down the AFP’s shift from internal security to territorial defense, as well as reverse the bureaucratic processes that President Aquino started when he decided to challenge China. Such moves may cause discontent within the AFP.

Third, Aquino has relied on a classic balancing strategy against China by engaging other major powers for diplomatic and military support. Fortunately, the United States and Japan have accommodated Aquino’s efforts to involve them in this balancing strategy by forging security arrangements with the Philippines. Alarmed by the Chinese military’s expansion in contested waters, the United States (with the support of Japan and other allies) has shown its naval and air prowess to constraint China from establishing primacy in the region.

Finally, the new president needs to examine China’s unilateral condition for any entente with the Philippines. Foreign   Minister Wang Yi, during his first visit to Manila, was very emphatic about China’s view that the Philippines is primarily responsible for the tension in the Philippine-China bilateral relationship and that “it is up to the Philippines to heal the rift over the South China Sea.” This means that the new president early in his term could possibly disregard the award (whether favorable or not for the Philippines) of the arbitral tribunal, gravitate away from its security partners (the United States and Japan), stop or slow down the AFP’s shift to territorial defense, accommodate China’s expansionist designs in the South China Sea by accepting an untested and untried method of joint development, and  not expecting any concession from China in return.

<strong>Conclusion </strong>

Whether or not President-elect Duterte continues President Aquino’s policy or pursues one of accommodation, it behooves him to consider these four very important factors. If he decides to accommodate China’s expansion in the South China Sea, Duterte will do well to reflect on how Filipinos, the United States, Japan, and global community will view his potentially risky gambit to engage with an emergent and expansionist East Asian power.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Blue crab sparking an international incident? Sounds unlikely, but it is a <a href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2016/06/11/25/0301000000AEN20160611002500315F.html">perennial problem</a> between China and South Korea at this time of year in the waters around the Korean Peninsula. Earlier this month, two Chinese fishing boats were seized by the Republic of Korea (ROK) maritime police after South Korean fishermen found them illegally fishing off Yeonpyeong Island in the Yellow Sea. Frustrated by illegal fishing, the South Korean fishermen had taken matters into their own hands and captured the Chinese boats before turning them over to the ROK authorities.

Just days later, on June 10, South Korean naval and marine forces <a href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2016/06/09/0200000000AEN20160609003851315.html?input=www.tweeter.com">carried out an operation</a> with the United Nations Command (UNC) to repel Chinese vessels illegally fishing in the mouth of the Han River estuary near the disputed maritime border between the two Koreas. Although this appears to be first time the UNC has participated in such an operation since the Korean War, the U.S.-led command was involved because certain provisions of the <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/korea/kwarmagr072753.html">1953 Korean War Armistice Agreement</a> cover the territory of the Han River estuary. <a href="http://www.usfk.mil/Media/Press-Releases/Article/796033/united-nations-command-conducts-armistice-enforcement-operations-in-han-river-e/">The UNC has authority to police the southern part</a> of the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) under the armistice and the operation was conducted within this demilitarized zone. This area is near but not on the disputed Northern Limit Line (NLL) between the two Koreas.

This is not the first time that Chinese vessels have clashed with South Korean military and police forces over illegal fishing in the Yellow Sea. According to the South Korean Ministry of Defense, Chinese fishing boats were <a href="http://www.mnd.go.kr/user/boardList.action?command=view&amp;page=1&amp;boardId=O_47261&amp;boardSeq=O_138100&amp;mcategoryId=&amp;id=mnd_eng_030100000000">found to be illegally operating</a> in the area approximately 120 times in 2015 and 520 times in 2016 (as of May). More deadly clashes resulted in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/11/world/asia/chinese-fishing-captain-killed-in-clash-with-south-korean-coast-guard.html?_r=0">death of a Chinese fishing boat captain</a> in 2014, the killing of <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/south-korea-cracks-down-on-illegal-chinese-fishing-1465550310">a member of the ROK coast guard</a> in 2011, and the deaths of two Chinese fishermen in 2010.

Disputes been China and South Korea over illegal fishing in Korean coastal waters have been a <a href="http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/jeasil5&amp;div=19&amp;id=&amp;page=">growing problem</a> since the early 2000s. According to the 2013 ROK Coast Guard White Paper, more than 2,100 illegal fishing boats and 540 fishermen were caught in South Korea’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) between 2008 and 2012. Recent news reports <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpO-hJx6pfY">cite even higher numbers</a>. But this is not a simple bilateral matter between China and South Korea. The situation is complicated by overlapping maritime disputes and competing territorial claims in both the Yellow Sea and East China Sea.

Most relevant to the recent incidents between Chinese fishing vessels and ROK naval and marine forces is the <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/asia/north-east-asia/198%20North%20Korea%20---%20The%20Risks%20of%20War%20in%20the%20Yellow%20Sea.pdf">NLL dispute between the two Koreas</a>. Chinese fishermen often <a href="http://www.nkeconwatch.com/2014/05/30/dprk-leases-rok-waters-to-chinese-fishermen/">enter into fishing contracts with North Korea</a> and then illegally cross the NLL to fish in South Korean waters. The long-standing conflict over this de-facto maritime border provides Chinese fishermen with an opportunity to continue their illegal fishing practices because of fears that actions against them could spark a military confrontation between North and South Korea. They take advantage of the fact that <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/asia/north-east-asia/198%20North%20Korea%20---%20The%20Risks%20of%20War%20in%20the%20Yellow%20Sea.pdf">control of the waters</a> around the <a href="http://www.ncnk.org/resources/publications/NCNK_Issue_Brief_NLL_September_2011.pdf">five Northwest Islands in the armistice agreement</a> and the area between the extended MDL and the NLL is disputed. In fact, Chinese illegal fishing is not just a persistent problem in South Korean-controlled waters, but in those patrolled by North Korea as well. The convergence of complicated trilateral interests between China, South Korea, and North Korea makes the maritime disputes difficult to resolve and ripe for further conflict.

The NLL dispute is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon and if anything appears to be getting worse since North Korean leader Kim Jong-un came to power in late 2011. Adding fuel to the fire is the fact that the applicable legal regimes are a tangled web of international law, bilateral fishing accords, the armistice agreement, and private fishing contracts. And even if the applicable law were clarified, the enforcement of maritime rules and norms would remain ineffective and spotty at best.

The NLL is perceived as an exclusively inter-Korean dispute not easily resolved through international law. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) might technically apply to this dispute if Pyongyang eventually ratifies the convention, but neither South nor North Korea now recognizes it application as such. Settling this inter-Korean conflict using UNCLOS and its dispute resolution mechanisms could <a href="http://38north.org/2010/07/the-maritime-boundary-between-north-south-korea-in-the-yellow-west-sea/">disadvantage one side</a> or the other, which is a risk neither seems willing to take.

The Agreement on Fisheries between the Republic of Korea and China, signed in 2000, does not provide a good mechanism for resolution of the illegal fishing problem. The agreement is ambiguous with respect to illegal fishing in the area around the NLL and has no dispute settlement clause. China and South Korea are parties to UNCLOS, but even in the unlikely case that both agreed to submit to the convention’s dispute settlement processes and the issue was covered by the treaty’s provisions, the overlapping dispute with North Korea would likely make a resolution impossible.

Given that this problem is not easily resolved through legal means, the South Korean government should seek to address the problems that contribute to illegal Chinese fishing through diplomatic and political mechanisms. The ROK government should use both bilateral and multilateral means to encourage the Chinese government to tackle this issue more forcefully. The primary causes for the increase in illegal Chinese fishing activity include:
<ol>
 	<li>Depletion of fish stocks in China’s coastal waters due to pollution and overexploitation of fishery resources;</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
 	<li>Growing demand for seafood in China, which allows Chinese fishermen to earn greater profits, increasing the incentives for illegal and aggressive fishing;</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
 	<li>Poor understanding of applicable maritime laws combined with traditional fishing practices, leading some Chinese fishermen to believe they have fishing privileges in Korean waters;</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
 	<li>Fear of accidental inter-Korean military confrontation in the grey zone around the NLL;</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
 	<li>Failure of diplomatic pressure to convince the Chinese government to police its own fishing vessels, combined with South Korea’s limited resources to effectively guard against illegal fishing.</li>
</ol>
To address these problems the South Korean government should:
<ol>
 	<li>Work with China and its neighbors to reduce pollution and resupply fishery stocks in Chinese coastal waters. This could include more active enforcement of environmental treaties, norms, and regulations, increased participation in regional bodies dealing with these issues, and technical exchanges between Chinese and Korean experts.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
 	<li>Encourage multilateral cooperation between other countries affected by illegal Chinese fishing practices, including Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
 	<li>Create education programs for Chinese fishermen that include lessons about the dangers of operating near the NLL and the risks of illegal fishing.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
 	<li>Strengthen efforts to improve emergency communication channels and confidence building measures between North and South Korea to lessen the possibilities of military confrontation. These could include <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/asia/north-east-asia/north-korea/198-north-korea-the-risks-of-war-in-the-yellow-sea.aspx">establishing naval hotlines, implementing common radio frequencies for ships, and creating shared signals</a> that demonstrate intent of vessels in disputed maritime regions.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">

		<title>Judgment Day: The South China Sea Tribunal Issues Its Ruling</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today an arbitral tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague <a href="#docjump" target="_blank">issued a long-awaited ruling</a> in Manila’s case against Beijing’s claims in the South China Sea. The five-judge tribunal was established under the compulsory dispute settlement provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and despite China’s refusal to participate in the proceedings, its ruling is final and legally binding.

For a closer look at the tribunal’s ruling and the areas it leaves legally disputed in the South China Sea, visit the <a href="/arbitration-map/" target="_blank">Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative’s new interactive map.</a>

<h3>Q1: What did the court rule?</h3>

<strong>A1:</strong> The judges issued a unanimous decision in favor of the Philippines on the overwhelming majority of the claims it made against China. They invalidated Beijing’s claims to ill-defined historic rights throughout the nine-dash line, finding that any claims it makes in the South China Sea must be made based on maritime entitlements from land features. The tribunal ruled that any other historic rights China might once have claimed in what are now the exclusive economic zones (EEZ) or continental shelves of other countries were invalidated by its ratification of UNCLOS. On the question of specific maritime entitlements over disputed features, the court found that Scarborough Shoal is a rock entitled only to a 12-nautical-mile territorial sea. The judges cannot rule on sovereignty over that shoal, but ruled that China has violated the traditional fishing rights of Filipinos by not allowing them to fish at the shoal. Notably the tribunal said it would have found the same regarding Chinese fishermen if they were prevented access to the shoal by the Philippines.

In the Spratly Islands, the court surprised many observers by ruling on the legal status of every feature raised by the Philippines. It found that none of the Spratlys, including the largest natural features—Itu Aba, Thitu Island, Spratly Island, Northeast Cay, and Southwest Cay—are legally islands because they cannot sustain a stable human community or independent economic life. As such, they are entitled only to territorial seas, not EEZs or continental shelves. Of the seven Spratlys occupied by China, the court agreed with the Philippines that Johnson Reef, Cuarteron Reef, and Fiery Cross Reef are rocks, while Hughes Reef and Mischief Reef are below water at high-tide and therefore generate no maritime entitlements of their own. It disagreed with the Philippines on the question of Gaven Reef, finding that it is a rock, not a low-tide elevation, as well as on Kennan Reef (which China does not occupy but was introduced into the case). Additionally, the court ruled that Second Thomas Shoal and Reed Bank are submerged and belong to the Philippine continental shelf. 

Taken together, these decisions effectively invalidate any Chinese claim within the nine-dash line to more than the disputed islets themselves and the territorial seas they generate (excepting around the Paracels farther north). In addition, the judges ruled that China violated its responsibilities under UNCLOS by engaging in widespread environmental destruction via its construction of artificial islands; violated Philippine sovereign rights by interfering with oil and gas exploration at Reed Bank; and illegally constructed a facility on Mischief Reef, which sits on the Philippine continental shelf. The only questions on which the tribunal found that it lacks jurisdiction were those involving China’s blockade and other harassment of Philippine troops upon the BRP Sierra Madre at Second Thomas Shoal. Those questions fell within the exception to arbitration relating to military matters, which China claimed under article 298 of UNCLOS.

<h3>Q2: What comes next?</h3>

<strong>A2:</strong> China has been clear that it will not accept any decision from the court, and there is no enforcement mechanism for the ruling. However, China will suffer considerable reputational cost from the ruling and this could help convince Beijing over the medium-to-long term to bring its claims into accordance with international law and treat fairly with Manila and the other claimants. Recognizing this, the Philippines and partners like Japan and the United States will not only be issuing their own statements calling on both parties to abide by the ruling, but they will urge as many other nations as possible to do the same.

Historically, major powers have often resisted the rulings of international tribunals, only to eventually find a politically acceptable means to accommodate them. Whether or not Beijing will follow that pattern is an open question, and so this will be an important test case of whether a strong international consensus can be sustained vis-à-vis Chinese rejection of international law and whether Beijing will in the end accommodate the expectations of its neighbors.

Beijing recognizes that international solidarity will be the real determinant of whether the case has long-term impact, and has been working to rally countries behind a counter-narrative of China as the victim. Despite Chinese government claims to the contrary, this effort has had limited success. CSIS’s Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative <a href="/arbitration-support-tracker/">has documented that</a>, on the eve of the ruling, just eight nations had sided with China, calling the tribunal’s proceedings illegitimate, while 40 had voiced support for the outcome as legally binding. 

How many more will speak up now that a decision has been reached? And how many will continue to do so in bilateral meetings, international forums, and UN General Assembly votes for the years it might take to convince China of the costs it is incurring? All eyes will be on whether the Philippines’ closest neighbors in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, who have varying degrees of ties with China, will be able to develop a common statement on the court’s ruling. Ultimately, the success of Manila’s legal effort depends not on the immediate aftermath of this ruling, but on whether the Philippines and likeminded countries including the United States can sustain enough reputational pressure to eventually convince Beijing to seek a face-saving way out.

<h3>Q3: How might China react in the near-term?</h3>

<strong>A3:</strong> China’s reaction will depend how much room Beijing decides it still has to maneuver in the wake of the ruling, as well as the reactions of the Philippines, the United States, and others. China may not make any immediate moves other than publicly rejecting the tribunal’s ruling. As host of the G-20 Summit in early September and an offer by the Philippines’ new president Rodrigo Duterte for talks on de-escalation and resource sharing, Beijing may respond with restraint for the time being. If so, this would be an important opportunity for dialogue.
  
But in light of today’s sweeping ruling against several of the core arguments that undergird China's approach to dealing with the South China Sea, Beijing may feel compelled to demonstrate that it is undeterred in the face of what some in the senior leadership are sure to see as a concerted U.S. and allied campaign to undermine China's sovereignty claims. Doing so would serve as retaliation against Manila for its refusal to drop the case, could dissuade others like Vietnam and Indonesia from following in the Philippines’ footsteps, and would send a message that China will not be bound by the ruling. These steps are more likely to occur several months from now, after the G20, but could come sooner. 

One act of retaliation could be island building at Scarborough Shoal. Beijing already resolved to undertake land reclamation at Scarborough in March but was deterred by strong signaling from Washington, including the extended operations of the USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier in the area, patrols near the shoal by A-10 Warthogs deployed to Clark Air Base, and direct warnings from President Barack Obama and Defense Secretary Ashton Carter. Scarborough Shoal’s location—just 185 nautical miles from Manila and situated near the entrance to the Luzon Strait separating the Philippines and Taiwan—makes the establishment of a Chinese military base there strategically unacceptable to both Washington and Manila. Reclamation would also carry enormous diplomatic and economic costs, and would be difficult, <a href="/developing-scarborough-contingency-plan/" target="_blank">albeit not impossible</a>, to prevent if China determines to make the attempt.

An even more escalatory, though perhaps less likely, Chinese reaction could be the imposition of a blockade of the Philippine marines stationed aboard the derelict BRP Sierra Madre at Second Thomas Shoal. Chinese ships prevented resupply of those marines for several months in early 2014, forcing the Philippines to drop supplies by air. Eventually a Philippine civilian ship carrying international and domestic journalists ran the blockade and the Chinese ships backed off. A new blockade could lead to violence, thereby drawing the U.S. military into a direct response under the requirements of its mutual defense treaty with the Philippines. 

Other possible retaliations include moving up the timeline on actions that Beijing has already determined to undertake. China could deploy the first rotation of fighter jets to its facilities on Fiery Cross, Subi, and Mischief reefs. The runways at all three have been built to accommodate fighters, and, at least at Fiery Cross, hangars have been constructed to house them. Beijing could also decide to declare archipelagic baselines around the Spratlys Islands—something that it has explicitly reserved the right to do since establishing baselines around its mainland and the Paracel Islands in 1996. Doing so would be a serious threat to freedom of navigation, since it would amount to a declaration that the waters within the Spratly group were China’s internal waters, closed to all surface and air traffic by any other nation. It would also be a direct contravention of today’s court ruling.

The deployment of air assets and drawing of straight baselines around the Spratlys would also be the likely precursors to another major escalation: the declaration of an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) over the South China Sea. As occurred when China declared an ADIZ over the East China Sea in 2013, the militaries of the United States and Japan, along with most claimant states and others like Australia, would rapidly violate the zone. But most, if not all, civilian air traffic would comply with China’s demands. This would not only heighten the risks of air-to-air incidents between militaries, but would represent another attempt to establish de facto, if not de jure, control over civilian activities throughout the South China Sea. 

These are only some of the possible escalatory activities that China could undertake in response to today’s ruling. But they all indicate that while the tribunal’s decision could prove useful in managing the South China Sea disputes in the long run, the short-term result is likely to be heightened tensions.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Philippines’ <a href="https://amti.csis.org/arbitration-ruling-analysis/">legal victory</a> at The Hague was nothing short of historic. Most observers expected a favorable outcome for Manila, but few thought it would be such a clean sweep. The Southeast Asian country secured victory in almost every single claim in <a href="https://amti.csis.org/arbitration-101-philippines-v-china/">its memorial</a>, including the most sensitive items concerning China’s <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2016/06/chinas-historic-rights-in-the-south-china-sea-made-in-america/">claim of “historic rights</a>,” which underpins Beijing’s sweeping nine-dash line claim throughout the South China Sea.

On almost all its arguments, the Philippines not only convinced the arbitral tribunal to exercise jurisdiction, but to also award a favorable verdict. This means a lot to the Philippines, which has invested the bulk of its diplomatic capital in a years-long but inherently uncertain lawfare effort. The outcome is a vindication of the decision by the Benigno Aquino administration to take the South China Sea disputes to international arbitration shortly after China seized control of Scarborough Shoal.

To the surprise of many ordinary Filipinos, who celebrated the verdict as a moral victory and boost for the rule of law in the oceans, the newly-inaugurated <a href="https://amti.csis.org/will-duterte-administration-mean/">Rodrigo Duterte</a> administration uncharacteristically called for “restraint and sobriety.” Shortly after the verdict was announced, Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay, in an extremely subdued and brief speech, <a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/07/12/1602130/dfa-calls-restraint-sobriety-after-tribunal-favors-philippines">simply announced</a> that government experts "are studying the Award with the care and thoroughness that this significant arbitral outcome deserves.”

The seemingly tepid response from the Duterte administration reflects a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/philippines-incoming-leader-duterte-pursue-independent-foreign-policy-130757913--business.html">simmering paradigm shift</a> in Manila’s foreign policy, <a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/137093/duterte-tells-china-build-us-a-railway-and-lets-set-aside-differences-for-a-while">particularly</a> toward China. Unlike its predecessor, the new government is interested in rehabilitating long-frayed bilateral ties with China in order to <a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/138454/duterte-ph-not-prepared-to-go-to-war-with-china">avoid military conflict</a> and revive <a href="https://amti.csis.org/the-diplomatic-implications-of-philippines-china-arbitration/">investment relations</a>, particularly in the <a href="http://www.rappler.com/nation/137177-duterte-china-build-manila-clark-railway">realm of infrastructure</a>. Two weeks into office, Duterte is confronting a major foreign policy dilemma, excruciatingly caught between a rock and a hard place.

<h2>The Ruling Outcome Mapped</h2>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">The tribunal invalidated Beijing’s claims to historic rights within the nine-dash line and found that Scarborough Shoal and those Spratlys that are above water at high-tide are rocks entitled only to a 12-nautical-mile territorial sea, not islands.</span></em>

<h2>De Jure Victory</h2>
Some leading experts <a href="https://amti.csis.org/intense-maneuvers-at-the-hague/">were concerned</a> that the tribunal would partially water down its ruling in order to prevent a full-fledged estrangement of China, which has engaged in a systematic campaign of <a href="https://www.raissarobles.com/2016/07/10/exclusive-china-secretly-lobbied-with-arbitral-court-to-scrap-philippine-suit-on-south-china-sea/">delegitimizing and denigrating</a> the arbitration proceedings.

Beijing, which boycotted the whole process, has accused the tribunal of having “failed to be impartial” and behaving in a “careless,” “law abusing,” and “irresponsible” manner.

China aggressively <a href="http://www.pcacases.com/web/sendAttach/1506">lobbied court officials</a> to dismiss the case, even threatening to withdraw from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) altogether. On the diplomatic front, China claimed the support of <u>up to 60 </u> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-36767252">countries</a> in opposing the arbitration case, while announcing earlier this year that it would push ahead with <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/03/13/asia-pacific/china-create-international-maritime-judicial-center-amid-rising-sea-tensions/">setting up alternative</a> international arbitration bodies.

Though China never formally participated in the proceedings, it tried to <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1217147.shtml">undermine</a> <u> </u>the Philippines’ arbitration case by raising objections regarding jurisdiction and admissibility. China questioned the tribunal’s competence to adjudicate issues that Beijing considers fundamentally related to sovereignty, which falls outside the mandate of UNCLOS and arbitral bodies under its aegis. China tried to absolve itself of any responsibility to abide by the ruling by citing exemptions to arbitration over certain types of disputes permitted by <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part15.htm">Article 298</a> of UNCLOS. It also accused the Philippines of abusing international law and undermining prior diplomatic agreements by resorting to compulsory arbitration. But all of this was to no avail.

The tribunal delivered a legal <em>coup de grâce</em>, not only rejecting China’s jurisdictional arguments, but also declaring its claim of <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2016/06/chinas-historic-rights-in-the-south-china-sea-made-in-america/">historic rights</a> to be incompatible with prevailing international law. The judged noted “there was no evidence that China had historically exercised exclusive control over the <em>waters </em>or their resources.”
<h2>De Facto Challenges</h2>
The verdict is binding according to Article 296 of UNCLOS Article 11 of the convention’s Annex VII, but enforcement is a major concern. China has refused to abide by the ruling, declaring it “null and void.” Nonetheless, China has suffered a strategic setback. To begin with, the Philippines’ historic victory has set a tantalizing precedent for neighboring countries such as <a href="https://next.ft.com/content/76705ea8-e164-11e3-b59f-00144feabdc0">Vietnam</a> and <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/south-china-sea-indonesia-says-could-also-take-china-to-court-20151112-gkx03r.html">Indonesia</a> to pursue earlier threats to take China to court.

Moreover, major naval powers such as the United States and Japan could utilize the verdict as a legal justification for more frequent , perhaps even multilateral, <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2016-02-08/confronting-china-south-china-sea">freedom of navigation operations</a>
close to Chinese-occupied features in the Spratlys. This is one way to effectively “enforce” the verdict. In addition, non-compliance means that China, a country that claims to be a regional leader and a responsible power, risks being branded as an outlaw. That would be a huge loss to Chinese soft power.

The Duterte administration is more concerned with ensuring that the disputes do not escalate as a result of the arbitration. The new president has expressed his preference for a “<a href="http://news.abs-cbn.com/focus/06/30/16/duterte-to-seek-soft-landing-with-china-after-dispute-ruling">soft landing</a>” with China, <a href="http://www.mb.com.ph/duterte-reveals-no-taunt-or-flaunt-china-policy/">refusing to taunt</a> the Asian juggernaut by flaunting the verdict.

Meanwhile, he has repeatedly <a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/126835/duterte-to-military-attaches-ph-not-out-for-war-china-should-just-let-us-fish-in-seas">questioned</a> the <span style="line-height: 1.5;">United States’ commitment to the Philippines. It seems Duterte aims to use the verdict to extract certain concessions from China. In exchange for </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">moderating the official Philippine response to the ruling, Duterte is likely to seek greater access for Filipino fishermen in disputed water, and </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">assurances that China will not establish military facilities on Scarborough Shoal or impose an exclusion zone within the Philippines’ EEZ.</span>

While Duterte shares his predecessor’s strategic objectives to protect Philippine claims in the area, he is opting for a new tactical approach where engagement and direct dialogue with China play a central role. But the Philippine leader is also under tremendous pressure from domestic constituencies, as well as traditional partners like the United States and Japan, to adopt a more robust stance on the arbitration verdict. As the country that initiated the arbitration, it is extremely important for the Philippines to stand its ground and facilitate international efforts to rein in China’s maritime assertiveness.

Given his <a href="http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=TopStory&amp;title=duterte-rides-on-&amp;145excellent&amp;8217-trust-rating&amp;id=130331">excellent trust ratings</a> among the electorate and <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/789789/most-powerful-ph-leader-since-marcos">considerable influence</a> over other branches of government, Duterte could withstand any temporary backlash if he opts for engagement and a provisional <em>modus vivendi</em> with Beijing. But this represents a huge foreign policy gamble. His approach could unwittingly embolden a besieged China to up the ante.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[International law does not contain an enforcement mechanism comparable to those of domestic legal systems. However, in the majority of cases, states do comply with the decisions of international courts and tribunals, albeit to varying extents. The instances in which states explicitly defy courts’ decisions are few and far between. 

Two previous cases where states explicitly announced that they would not comply with the decision of a dispute settlement body are relevant to the <a href="https://amti.csis.org/arbitration-map/" target="_blank">Philippines v China arbitration.</a> These are the Nicaragua v United States case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the Arctic Sunrise case (Netherlands v Russia) before a UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) Annex VII arbitral tribunal.

<h2> Nicaragua v United States </h2>

In the <a href="https://amti.csis.org/podcast-arbitration-outcomes-paul-reichler-philippines-lead-counsel/" target="_blank">Nicaragua v United States</a> case, after the ICJ found that it had jurisdiction to entertain Nicaragua’s claims, the United States decided not to participate in the merits phase of the case. The United States further showed its disapproval by terminating the 1955 Treaty on Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation between Nicaragua and the United States and withdrawing its declaration under Article 36(2) of the UN Charter, which together provided the basis for the court’s jurisdiction in the case. In its 1986 judgment on the merits, the ICJ held that the United States had violated both treaty law and customary international law by supporting the Contra rebels, and ordered the United States to refrain from all such acts and make reparation to Nicaragua.

Instead the United States ignored Nicaragua’s request for negotiations on compensation and refused to stop its support for the Contras. Faced with the United States’ outright defiance of the decision, Nicaragua tried to enforce the judgment through various platforms. Article 94(2) of the UN Charter says, “If any party to a case fails to perform the obligations incumbent upon it under a judgment rendered by the Court, the other party may have recourse to the Security Council, which may, if it deems necessary, make recommendations or decide upon measures to be taken to give effect to the judgment.” Nicaragua accordingly turned to the UN Security Council, but several draft resolutions were never adopted due to the United States’ veto as a permanent member of the council. 

Nicaragua then turned to the UN General Assembly, where its endeavors proved to be more successful. The General Assembly adopted four resolutions calling for “full and immediate compliance with the Judgment of the International Court of Justice.” The United States, however, continued to say that the ICJ did not have jurisdiction in the case. Even as it began to bring claims before the ICJ again for damages, Nicaragua elected a new president who was backed by the United States and subsequently discontinued the proceedings in 1992.

The Nicaragua v United States case was perhaps the most prominent example of a state that did not appear before an international court and then openly defied its final decisions. In some ways, Nicaragua did not succeed in securing full U.S. compliance with the judgment. However, the litigation was not at all useless. 

Its strategy to resort to the Security Council and General Assembly had the effect of securing publicity for the issue, which helped convince the U.S. Congress to cut-off aid to the Contras in 1988. The United States subsequently lifted its trade embargo against Nicaragua in 1990 and provided the new government of Violeta Chamorro with a significant aid package. So, U.S. non-compliance notwithstanding, Nicaragua’s initiation of the case and its subsequent strategy eventually helped secure its intended outcome.

<h2>Arctic Sunrise</h2>

In the Arctic Sunrise case, Russia rejected arbitration initiated by the Netherlands in 2013 after Moscow seized the Arctic Sunrise, which was flying the Dutch flag, and its crew of Greenpeace activists. Russia refused to appear before the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) in the case for provisional measures and the Annex VII arbitral tribunal in the merits phase on the grounds that both tribunals lacked jurisdiction.

Russia did not comply with the request of ITLOS to immediately release the Arctic Sunrise and allow the non-Russian crew members to leave the country. However, Russia eventually implemented all the measures asked of it by ITLOS. Even though Russian authorities insisted that they released the vessel and crew according to domestic legislation and not because of the decision of the international court, the ultimate effect was the same. In August 2015, an Annex VII arbitral tribunal ordered Russia to compensate the Netherlands, which Russia has so far refused to do.

The Nicaragua v United States and Arctic Sunrise cases show that non-appearance does not necessarily lead to permanent non-compliance, whatever the rhetoric used. It may be tempting, therefore, to draw an analogy between these and the <a href="https://amti.csis.org/arbitration-ruling-analysis/" target="_blank">Philippines v China</a> case by envisioning a scenario in which Beijing, despite its rejection of the arbitration, will come to terms and comply, at least in large part, with the arbitral award. Nevertheless, one should be cautious about jumping to such conclusions. The main reason being that the subject-matter of the cases differs fundamentally. 

Unlike the South China Sea disputes, the seizure of the Arctic Sunrise was an isolated incident which involved only the two parties in the case. It was not a long-standing, politically sensitive dispute. As a result, the stakes in Russia “backing down” and were not as high as would be the case for China. In this regard, the Nicaragua v United States case may be of more relevance, given its political sensitivity.

The lack of enforcement mechanisms in international law does not mean that there are no costs to non-compliance. The few instances in which states openly defied a court or arbitral tribunal’s decisions have mostly involved great powers. But even in those cases, decisions that were initially ignored were eventually complied with to a certain extent.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="https://amti.csis.org/arbitration-map/">July 12 verdict</a> of a tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration represented a watershed moment in the tumultuous history of the South China Sea dispute. Manila's overwhelming legal victory over Beijing already sent ripples across the region and the world. According to the AMTI <a href="https://amti.csis.org/arbitration-support-tracker/">Arbitration Support Tracker</a>, since the ruling 7 countries have publicly called for it to be respected, 33 have positively acknowledged it but fell short of calling for compliance, and just 4 have publicly rejected it. In effect, China's international reputation as a responsible, rising power is now under heavy fire, its narrative of peaceful rise subjected to international scrutiny, and its strategic maneuvering to back its sovereignty claims undermined.

But while the Philippines is celebrating its de jure victory, developments on the ground ought to be a cause of serious concern. In a seeming act of defiance, Chinese Coast Guard vessels continue to block Filipino fishermen who have attempted to sail to Scarborough Shoal in the wake of the ruling. It remains to be seen whether President Xi Jinping will continue to give primacy to domestic pressure over the international outcry by proceeding with artificial island construction at Scarborough, the deployment of military assets on China’s seven artificial islands in the Spratlys, and/or the declaration of an Air Defense Identification Zone over large swathes of the South China Sea.

How then could the Philippines translate its legal victory into reality on the ground, especially for the thousands of Filipino families whose livelihood are directly impacted by the ongoing maritime tensions? One possible answer may be the simultaneous pursuit of <em>deescalation</em> and <em>deterrence. </em>On the one hand, the Philippines should “set the tone” for peaceful resolution of the dispute through assertive diplomacy, in bilateral and multilateral fora, calling on China and other relevant parties to adhere to the rules-based order, in general, and the ruling, in particular. On the other hand, the Philippines must beef up its own military and law enforcement capabilities as well as strengthen its alliances with like-minded countries to effectively implement the rules and raise both the material and reputational cost for China's non-adherence.

<strong> </strong><strong>On Deescalation</strong>

Peaceful resolution of maritime disputes remains the strategic objective for the Philippines. Given that international law and public opinion are now fully in Manila’s favor, it is important that the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte play its cards well, both in its bilateral ties with China as well as multilateral engagements with fellow ASEAN member-states and extra-regional powers that share a common interest in the overall preservation of regional peace and stability. The Philippines should uphold the stipulations of the ruling as the basis for future resumption of high-level government-to-government talks and possible pursuit of foreign investment under a joint venture with China. It is imperative for the Philippines to provide reasonable time for China to manage the risk of growing nationalism at home while working to bring its maritime laws in line with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

In multilateral relations, the Philippines should actively present its case as a legal precedent for ASEAN claimant-states to further clarify their respective maritime entitlements and boundaries as well as align their domestic policies on fishing rights and mineral/oil and gas exploration with UNCLOS. This would eventually serve as legal basis for future maritime delimitation and resource-sharing agreements among ASEAN claimant-states and between ASEAN claimants and China, thereby reducing the risk of violent encounters at sea. Furthermore, the Philippines should harness its newfound moral high ground to push for the adherence of all parties to the ASEAN-China Declaration of Conduct for Parties in the South China Sea and expedite the conclusion of a binding Code of Conduct. Finally, the Philippines must build on its political capital by persisting in sending a clear message in upcoming regional fora such as the ASEAN Summit and East Asia Summit that it is in China’s long-term interests to play a constructive role as a rising power, abide by the terms of the ruling, and prevent further coercive activities that destabilize the region.

<strong>On Deterrence </strong>

While pursuing ways to diffuse maritime tension and lay the groundwork for future cooperation with China on the diplomatic front, the Philippine government should not lose sight of the necessity to effectively implement the arbitral ruling and increase the risk calculus for China's non-compliance with UNCLOS. Hence, the Duterte administration ought to use the ruling as a legal foundation for updating its comprehensive defense and security plans for the South China Sea, and a political justification for increasing the defense budget and accelerating naval and coast guard modernization. Duterte could immediately use his huge political capital to urge the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine Coast Guard to speed up their acquisition of naval assets and coast guard vessels to effectively prevent present and future encroachments of Chinese Coast Guard vessels and fishing militia in waters already deemed by the tribunal to be under Philippine jurisdiction. In the long-term, the Philippines ought to coordinate government and civil society efforts to upgrade military outposts and develop civilian communities in the Spratlys as well as invest in modern asymmetric and defensive capabilities to challenge China's “swarm” or “<a href="http://thediplomat.com/2013/10/chinas-expanding-cabbage-strategy/">cabbage strategy</a>.”

Along with beefing up its navy and coast guard capabilities, the Philippines may opt to synchronize its defense plan with fellow ASEAN maritime powers, such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia to prevent undue incidents among themselves and come up with a more unified front to effectively repulse Chinese encroachments in their territorial waters and exclusive economic zones. Furthermore, the Philippines should capitalize on the ruling to further strengthen its military partnerships with and gain more concessions from the United States, under the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) framework, as well as Japan, South Korea, Australia and the European Union, all of whom have a shared interest in the preservation of freedom of navigation. This may entail more joint interoperability training, greater rotational presence, technology and capital transfer, and even the creation of defense economic zones in the Philippines which could be hubs for naval/coast guard ship manufacturing.

<strong>Toward a Balanced Liberal and Realpolitik Approach</strong>

Manila’s legal triumph over Beijing was not just about the Philippines’ assertion of its inherent right as a sovereign nation to defend its maritime entitlements under international law for present and future generations of Filipinos. It was a hard-won victory for the international rules-based order against nineteenth century-style gunboat diplomacy. Now it is imperative that the Philippines not rest on its laurel, but rather exhaust all means for the ruling to be implemented and the liberal order preserved. Therefore, the country ought to strike a delicate balance between assertive diplomacy (the liberal approach) that advocates for China and the international community to respect the sanctity of the law of the oceans as a pillar of stability and prosperity for all; and beef up its navy and coast guard while strengthening alliances (the realpolitik approach) that provides the much need teeth for the ruling to be effectively observed in the absence of any other enforcement mechanism. Only then will the region be able to keep the peace.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When the tribunal deciding the <a href="https://amti.csis.org/arbitration-map/">South China Sea arbitration</a> case brought by the Philippines against China issued its award on July 12, the international media seemed impressed by the <a href="https://amti.csis.org/podcast-arbitration-outcomes-paul-reichler-philippines-lead-counsel/">landslide decision</a> in favor of the Philippines on almost all of its claims. Many reported that the ruling was a rebuke of China’s sovereignty claims, but this is a misinterpretation.

<strong>The Nine-Dash Line</strong>

A tribunal like this one, constituted under Annex VII of the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), can only rule on disputes concerning the interpretation or application of the convention. Questions of sovereignty are beyond its purview. With respect to the nine-dash line, the <a href="http://www.pcacases.com/pcadocs/PH-CN%20-%2020160712%20-%20Award.pdf">tribunal concluded</a>, “China’s claim to historic rights to the living and non-living resources within the ‘nine-dash line’ is incompatible with the Convention to the extent that it exceeds the limits of China’s maritime zones as provided for by the Convention.”

The tribunal ruled on the nine-dash line only as a “claim to historic rights to the living and non-living resources” of the sea, but not as a claim to sovereignty over the land features within it, which would be beyond the tribunal’s jurisdiction. Furthermore, the judges ruled only that China’s claim to historic rights is incompatible with UNCLOS where that claim “exceeds the limits of China’s maritime zone.”

China has never clarified the nature and extent of the rights it claims via the nine-dash line. The inventor of the line was not the People’s Republic of China government, but rather its predecessor, the Nationalist Kuomintang government, now sitting as an opposition party in Taiwan. The claim’s ambiguity has merit from the Chinese perspective because it helps avoid controversies that could be caused by its precise definition and leaves room for interpretation. The arbitration now gives China an incentive to clarify the nature and meaning of the nine-dash line.

In its <a href="https://amti.csis.org/beijings-and-washingtons-dueling-south-china-sea-papers/">position paper</a> on the tribunal’s jurisdiction, Beijing argued that “without first having determined China’s territorial sovereignty over the maritime features in the South China Sea, the Arbitral Tribunal will not be in a position to determine the extent to which China may claim maritime rights in the South China Sea pursuant to the Convention, not to mention whether China’s claims exceed the extent allowed under the Convention.” And as already mentioned, the issue of territorial sovereignty falls outside the scope of UNCLOS.

China further argued that even if the subject-matter of the case were determined to have nothing to do with sovereignty, it would still “be an integral part of maritime delimitation.” China in 2006 made a declaration, as allowed by UNCLOS, exempting itself from arbitration in disputes concerning delimitation.

From these statements, one can assume that, in addition to any historic rights claimed within it, the nine-dash line is also a claim to sovereignty over land features in the South China Sea as well as a sea boundary. These aspects of the line are beyond the purview of UNCLOS compulsory dispute settlement procedures. Therefore, the nine-dash line could still have a legal basis, but it needs to be further clarified.

Since the nine-dash line cannot be separated from issues of sovereignty and maritime boundary delimitation, the arbitral tribunal should have found that it lacked jurisdiction to rule on the line’s validity. This constituted a major reason for China to reject participation in and acceptance of the arbitration from the start.

<strong>Far-Reaching Precedents</strong>

The tribunal’s ruling involved three other unprecedented decisions that will have far-reaching legal consequences. First, the court <a href="https://pcacases.com/web/sendAttach/1801">ruled that</a> China has claimed “historic rights short of title” (questions of historic title being exempted from arbitration by China’s 2006 declaration). They found that the use of the South China Sea by Chinese fishermen and navigators in the past amounted to “the exercise of high seas freedoms,” not a special historic right, and argued that China had never exercised “exclusive control over the waters of the South China Sea or prevented other States from exploiting their resources.” This narrow definition sets a precedent that will make it very difficult for other states to assert historic rights despite any other non-exclusive authority they may have exercised over the waters in question.

Second, the arbitrators determined the legal status of land features—as rocks, islands, or submerged—without considering the fact that sovereignty over those features is disputed. Sovereignty disputes are beyond the purview of UNCLOS and its compulsory dispute settlement procedures. This ruling suggests that a state can institute arbitration proceedings concerning the legal status of any disputed land feature it claims.

Finally, the arbitration sets a precedent that the legal status of land features can be decided without field study or first-hand evidence. The verdict on the status of the largest natural high-tide elevation in the Spratly Islands, <a href="https://amti.csis.org/exploring-itu-aba-virtual-tour-south-china-sea-islet/">Itu Aba (Taiping) Island</a>, is the most controversial example. Despite the fact that Itu Aba has wells with a daily output of 60 tons of fresh water and locally grown crops, the judges ruled it a rock not capable of sustaining “human habitation or economic life of [its] own” based on historical evidence. According to the tribunal, it is therefore not entitled to an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) or continental shelf.

The decision on Itu Aba has not only aroused strong protests from Taiwan, but <a href="https://amti.csis.org/will-others-respect-precedent-set-philippines-case/">sets a precedent</a> that could call undermine maritime claims made by other countries based on small land features. For example, Japan’s Okinotorishima is much less capable of sustaining human habitation than Itu Aba, yet Tokyo claims it is entitled to an EEZ and continental shelf.

Due to these and other perceived flaws in the ruling, many Chinese approve of the foresight in Beijing’s “Four Nos” policy—non-admission, non-participation, non-acceptance, and non-implementation. The general impression among the Chinese public is that the award was one-sided and unfair, and the nationalist mood has risen to the extent that the government has been forced to intervene to prevent protests. Beijing has reiterated its desire to resolve the disputes by direct negotiations and work with other states in the region to maintain peace and stability. But it remains out of the question for China to accept the arbitration ruling as a premise for future bilateral negotiations with the Philippines. As a result, it might not be easy to calm the South China Sea anytime soon.]]></content:encoded>
