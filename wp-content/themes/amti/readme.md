# Theme: amti

This theme was created in 2016 and is based off of the [\_s theme](https://github.com/automattic/_s). It uses Gulp as a task runner to compile Sass to CSS. The Gulp workflow could also be used to minify images or bundle JavaScript, but the project is not set up to do that as of May 2021.

## Development

To begin development, navigate to the theme directory and start npm.

```shell
$ cd wp-content/themes/amti
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Build/production

To build the theme for production, navigate to the theme directory and run the build script.

```shell
$ cd wp-content/themes/amti
$ npm run build
```

See the main project [README](https://github.com/CSIS-iLab/amti_2016) for further information.
