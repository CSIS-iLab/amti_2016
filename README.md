# amti_2016

WordPress site for [AMTI](https://amti.csis.org/). Developed from the [\_s starter theme](http://underscores.me). It uses gulp, Sass, Autoprefixer, PostCSS, imagemin, and Browsersync to speed-up development.

**Note:** This theme was originally created in 2016, and does not reflect the current code standards of the CSIS iLab. While the structure of the project is similar to the [CSIS Starter](https://github.com/CSIS-iLab/csisstarter_wp), they are not identical. Style linting has been disabled on this project.

## Quick-start Instructions

To begin development, navigate to `wp_content/themes/amti` directory and start npm.

```shell
$ cd wp-content/themes/amti
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions will automatically build & deploy the theme to either the development, staging, or production environment on WPE depending on the settings specified in the deployment workflow.

- Pull requests into `main` will be deployed to the [WP Engine Development Environment](https://amtidev.wpengine.com/). The Development environment should be used to demo new features to programs. Once approved, a pull request should be submitted to `main`.

### See More Commands

This will display all available commands, such as running eslint or imagemin independently.

```shell
$ npm run
```
